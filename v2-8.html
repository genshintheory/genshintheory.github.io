<h2>Golden Apple</h2>
<p>Main event features Mona, Xinyan, Fischl, Kazuha on a trip back to Golden Apple Archipelago (金苹果群岛).
  Version also added a new story quest for Kazuha and hangout event for Heizou, the new Anemo catalyst user.
</p>

<h2>Hidden Strife</h2>
<p>
Event features Diluc, his new skin, and the Dawn Winery.
It has a challenge mode where you face enemies.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Day 1: use elemental bursts a certain number times to trigger an effect, defeat powerful enemies.
    Raiden national team works well here as this team involves spamming bursts repeatedly.
    Quickswap teams that involve using many characters' bursts in succession also work.
  </li>
  <li>Day 2: Childe international, Raiden national teams work for the vaporize counts.
    Other than that, Pyro teams with your favorite pyro dps also work: Diluc, Yoimiya, etc.
  </li>
  <li>Day 3: Raiden/Yae teams work well for electro reactions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Diluc skin</h2>
<p>There are various parts of Diluc's design that seemingly allude to different parts of history, culture, and literature.
  This together makes Diluc a very richly and intelligently designed character, arguably one of the best designed characters in game to date.
  Diluc's skin seems to be yet another literary reference chosen by Genshin: 'Red Dead of Night'.
  It is an interesting name and an interesting choice.
  It goes back to the point that Diluc himself is a man of many paradoxes,
  an example of win-win design.
</p><p>
  Diluc's new skin appears to have a new voiceline with it.
</p><p>
  Fischl (or Amy) also has a new skin that can be earned for free by completing Golden Apple events.
</p>

<h2>Yoimiya banner</h2>
<p>The Yoimiya banner features Yun Jin, Bennett, and Xinyan.
  The 4 star lineup is the best and strongest to date.
  Both Yun Jin and Bennett are top tier universal buffers.
  Xinyan has featured on Yoimiya's first banner and on Raiden's rerun.
  Previously, Bennett featured on the Raiden banner alongside Sara and Xinyan.
  Before that Bennett has appeared on Albedo and Kazuha banners.
  But on Yoimiya's banner, both Yun Jin and Bennett are excellent buffers that work for almost all characters in the game.
  Yun Jin may be a bit more niche than Bennett, but she is not as niche as some of the other characters Bennett has featured alongside.
  Moreover, for normal attacks specifically, Yun Jin can even provide a bigger buff than Bennett, which is something very few characters can do
  as Bennett is widely heralded as the best buffer in the game.
  Running Yun Jin and Bennett with Yoimiya is to compensate for putting Kazuha, Heizou, and Klee together in the first phase.
</p><p>
  Yoimiya's weapon banner features the Thundering Pulse, an excellent bow with crit damage, and the Summit Shaper.
  There were rumors that perhaps the Wolf's Gravestone or Skyward Spine would feature alongside TP.
  In either case, that would make the weapon banner one of the best of all time.
  But in 2.6 Ayaka's weapon banner featured the claymore, and in 2.7 Itto's weapon banner featured the catalyst in the same series.
  But still, Yoimiya was ran solo in the second half of 2.8 right before the anticipated introduction of Sumeru in 3.0.
  And Yoimiya has been the target of repeated harassment from the USA media and smear campaigns,
  so the fireworks girl deserves more love.
