  <p>Kirara (绮良良 Qiliangliang), a nekomata youkai of the Komaniya express, is a dendro shielder debuting in 3.7,
    reminds one of Eula, Sayu, etc. and the crimes Zhu Di committed on Qi Tai.
    The other parts of Kirara's intro can allude to Lan Yu, Yu Qian, Ding Yu, and others executed by Zhu during the Ming dynasty.
    But most likely, this is just another interference in corporate affairs like Kaveh,
    which is getting weak and boring.
  </p><p>
    While the Ming dynasty made a certain general related to liang quite famous,
    there is a history that goes way before the Ming.
    It is related to a number of successor states of China that existed before the Tang dynasty.
    It is also related to a certain emperor that was murdered in his crib (to use a metaphor) before the Tang was founded.
    If one goes that far back in history, it makes some sense why one of Eula's voice actors was chosen and why she is so bent on revenge.
    Added to that there could be a personal reason to that choice as well.
  </p><p>
    Qiliang may as well be a very common name in China, but it happens to be the name of a certain scientist.
    The name Qiliang also sounds vaguely familiar to something personal, a certain person who passed away earlier in the year.

  <h2>Combat</h2>
  <p>Kirara's E creates a dendro shield. 
    Her Q does a dendro nuke that creates smaller bomblets like Aloy's skill.
    These bomblets can be clustered and pulled via anemo vacuum abilities like Sucrose E.
  </p>
  <p>Using hold E will generate the shield and turn Kirara into a box 
    that can move around fast, jump, and even climb up walls.
    <!-- It supposedly can jump higher too. really? -->
    The press cd is 8s.
    By holding E the cd can be longer up to 12s.
    Note the cd starts after leaving the box cat state.
