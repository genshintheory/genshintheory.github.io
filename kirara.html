<title>Kirara</title>

  <p>Kirara (绮良良 Qiliangliang), a dendro character anticipated to debut in 3.7,
    reminds one of Eula, Sayu, etc. and the crimes Zhu Di committed on Qi Tai.
    The other parts of Kirara's intro can allude to Lan Yu, Yu Qian, and others executed by Zhu during the Ming dynasty.
    But most likely, this is just another interference in corporate affairs like Kaveh,
    which is getting weak and boring.
