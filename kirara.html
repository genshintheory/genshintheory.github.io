  <p>Kirara (绮良良 Qiliangliang), of the Komaniya express, is a dendro shielder debuting in 3.7,
    reminds one of Eula, Sayu, etc. and the crimes Zhu Di committed on Qi Tai.
    The other parts of Kirara's intro can allude to Lan Yu, Yu Qian, Ding Yu, and others executed by Zhu during the Ming dynasty.
    But most likely, this is just another interference in corporate affairs like Kaveh,
    which is getting weak and boring.
  </p><p>
    While the Ming dynasty made a certain general related to liang quite famous,
    there is a history that goes way before the Ming.
    It is related to a number of successor states of China that existed before the Tang dynasty.
    It is also related to a certain emperor that was murdered in his crib (to use a metaphor) before the Tang was founded.
    If one goes that far back in history, it makes some sense why one of Eula's voice actors was chosen and why she is so bent on revenge.
    Added to that there could be a personal reason to that choice as well.

  <h2>Combat</h2>
  <p>Kirara's E creates a dendro shield. Her Q does a dendro nuke that creates smaller bomblets like Aloy's skill.</p>
