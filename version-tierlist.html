<p>Version 1 is the best version to date overall: minimal interference from the pesky USA imperialists.
  Version 2 started strong but then got worse: the FBI and CIA started interfering more in fandom politics and inciting color revolutions.
  Version 3 started poorly: the CIA started to brainwash overseas media.
</p>
<p>
  Failure to control overseas media on your own product
  will eventually result in you being controlled by overseas media.
  It is a kill or be killed world.
  You either imperialize others and take control of their media,
  or the foreigners will imperialize you.
</p>
<p>Version 2.6 is F tier because of the Inazuma event and Yoshinori.
  Version 3.0 is F tier because of Tighnari.
  Version 1.6 and 2.8 are B tier because of Kazuha.
  Version 2.2 is B tier because that was when the FBI and CIA entrapped and attacked the genshin fandom 
  to overthrow their political enemies and incite color revolution.
  Version 2.4 is B tier because the Ganyu-Zhongli banner represented succumbing and giving into USA imperialist demands.
</p><p>
  Predicting in advance: Version 3.6 will probably be F tier because that is when Baizhu releases
  and the game may probably make some nasty political move involving Baizhu like what happened in 2.6.
  The game will have to do something extraordinary to make 3.6 not F tier.
</p><p>
  Version 3.7 has been placed at F tier for the choice of Kajikawa Shohei (梶川翔平). 
  A better choice for voice actor would be Fang since the game put that character in the event.
  Most of everything else would have qualified 3.7 for B or even A tier, but this immature choice sealed this version's fate.
  If hu tao, kokomi lost their matches, and wei failed to make the qualifications, then maybe the version would be B tier.
  But currently there are no redeeming features.
