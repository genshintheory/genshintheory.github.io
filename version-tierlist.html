<p>Version 1 is the best version to date overall: minimal interference from the pesky USA imperialists.
  Version 2 started strong but then got worse: the FBI and CIA started interfering more in fandom politics and inciting color revolutions.
  Version 3 started poorly: the CIA started to brainwash overseas media.
</p>
<p>
  Failure to control overseas media on your own product
  will eventually result in you being controlled by overseas media.
  It is a killed or be killed world.
  You either imperialize others and take control of their media,
  or the foreigners will imperialize you.

<p>Version 2.6 is F tier because of the Inazuma event and Yoshinori.
  Version 3.0 is F tier because of Tighnari.
  Version 1.6 and 2.8 are B tier because of Kazuha.
  Version 2.2 is B tier because that was when the FBI and CIA entrapped and attacked the genshin fandom 
  to overthrow their political enemies and incite color revolution.
  Version 2.4 is B tier because the Ganyu-Zhongli banner represented succumbing and giving into USA imperialist demands.
