<p>Version 1 is the best version to date overall: minimal interference from the pesky USA imperialists.
  Version 2 started strong but then got worse: the FBI and CIA started interfering more in fandom politics and inciting color revolutions.
  Version 3 started poorly: the CIA started to brainwash overseas media.
</p>
<p>
  Failure to control overseas media on your own product
  will eventually result in you being controlled by overseas media.
  It is a kill or be killed world.
  You either imperialize others and take control of their media,
  or the foreigners will imperialize you.
</p>
<p>Versions 2 and 3 as a whole are perhaps equally bad.
  Version 1 remains the best version to date by far.
  A challenge is: can version 4 be made to be better than versions 2 and 3?
  Asking for version 4 to be as good as version 1 is a tough ask (and probably not possible given the historic performance of versions 2 and 3).
  But asking for version 4 to be better than versions 2 and 3 is a bit more realistic.
</p>


<h2>General factors</h2>
<p>What decides how good a version is?
  For the above, story content (archon story, character story, event story) is one of the most important factors that can kill an entire version if done poorly.
  This is what happened to 2.6 and 3.6.
  Other factors include the characters introduced, their overall design, the choice of banners (how unequal they are), the general quality of translations,
  the amount of political attacks contained in translations, permanent content, and event content.
</p><p>
  New areas for exploration are introduced from time to time, but Genshin usually always gets an A+ for terrain design and exploration, 
  so that is usually not a deciding factor (unless there is some major screw-up).
</p>


<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Version 2.6 is F tier because of the Inazuma event and Yoshinori.
  Version 3.0 is F tier because of Tighnari.
  Version 1.6 and 2.8 are B tier because of Kazuha.
  Version 2.2 is B tier because that was when the FBI and CIA entrapped and attacked the genshin fandom 
  to overthrow their political enemies and incite color revolution.
  Version 2.4 is B tier because the Ganyu-Zhongli banner represented succumbing and giving into USA imperialist demands.
</p><p>
  Predicting in advance: Version 3.6 will probably be F tier because that is when Baizhu releases
  and the game may probably make some nasty political move involving Baizhu like what happened in 2.6.
  The game will have to do something extraordinary to make 3.6 not F tier.
</p><p>
  Version 3.7 has been placed at F tier for the choice of Kajikawa Shohei (梶川翔平). 
  A better choice for voice actor would be Fang since the game put that character in the event.
  Most of everything else would have qualified 3.7 for B or even A tier, but this immature choice sealed this version's fate.
  If hu tao, kokomi lost their matches, and wei failed to make the qualifications, then maybe the version would be B tier.
  But currently there are no redeeming features.
  To rule with severe punishment is even what Zhu Yuanzhang suggested.
  Thus, version 3.7 must be severely punished for this single mistake to discourage people from making the same mistake in the future
  and to ensure people remember their mistakes.
  Some people are pig-brained and only listen to other pigs, even if those pigs murdered 100,000 Chinese people.
</p><p>
  It has happened again in Genshin's history: two F tier versions in a row.
  People have gotten into a really bad habit of waiting until the last day of an event to reveal a political attack or promote a political clique
  to serve the interests of their USA overlords, to engage in bribery and corruption and think that money can buy everything.
  If this trend continues, then we predict in advance that 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 will also be F tier.
  Until people grow up and unless Genshin does something extraordinary to reverse the trend, this rating for future versions will not change.
</p>
<p>Version 3.8 could have been S tier if 1) in the version cover art, Klee, Collei, or Kokomi were in the 4th position
  and 2) if the choo-choo carts were given a different name (like what? ai-ai carts or meng-meng carts).
