  <h2>Sumeru</h2>
  <p>Although it was clear that Inazuma corresponds to Japan,
    people debate what exactly Sumeru corresponds to in the real world.  
  </p>
  <p>Based on the given information from versions 1 and 2,
    Sumeru appears to correspond to the geographic region
    spanning as far east as India and as far west as North Africa.
    Some say it corresponds to the so called SWANA region,
    encompassing Southwest Asia and North Africa.
    Although this vast territory roughly coincides with the Islamic world,
    not everything in Sumeru is based on Islamic influences.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, Sumeru also has some Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain influences,
    corresponding to the South Asian region.
    In Chinese, Sumeru is called 须弥 which is a Buddhist term referring to Mount Meru.
    Some people identify Mount Meru as being located in the Pamir mountains or Kashmir.
    This corresponds to a land bordering China, Central Asia, and South Asia.
    But geographically, if Liyue represents China, then Sumeru represents what is west of China.
  </p>
  <p>
    The names of some Sumeru NPCs also point to Persian influences as well in the region.
    There also appear to be Arabic influences in Sumeru as well.
    Some speculate that Cyno, who was featured in the Teyvat trailer,
    is based on Egyptian culture.
  </p><p>
    It should be noted that North Africa, the Levant, West Asia, Persia, and India
    all had their own cultures and histories before the Islamic Arabic empires that rose during the 7th century and after.
    Egypt has thousands of years of history before Islam.
    Persia also has its own history with the Persian Empire and Hellenic culture before the Arabs arrived.
    And of course South Asia and India has thousands of years of history with Buddhism and Hinduism before Islam arrived to the subcontinent.
    Even the Mesopotamia region, one of the oldest cradles of civilization, between the Tigris and Euphrates,
    existed long before Islam.
    So to encompass such a vast region with distinct histories and cultures is quite a task.
  </p><p>
    Also whereas Mondstadt, Liyue, and Inazuma may be united by a similar language and culture,
    what is the common theme that binds Sumeru together?
    If one looks at SWANA, there are at least 2-4 distinct language families comprising the region:
    the Afro-Asiatic (Semitic) languages with Arabic being dominant
    and the Indo-Aryan languages (including Farsi, Hindustani, etc).
    If one wants to include even more of the Indian subcontinent, then Dravidian would be another family.
    But there is even one more language family: the Turkic languages
    as the region from India, Iran, to North Africa and West Asia
    has also seen the rise of various Turkic Islamic empires
    such as the Seljuk, Timurid, Mughal, and Ottoman empires.
  </p><p>
    If there is any one thing binding such a huge and diverse region together,
    it would probably be a shared history and culture of Islam.
  </p>
  <p>
    If there is a single country in the world that could be said to incorporate influences from all these various cultures,
    it would probably be Pakistan or even Afghanistan.
    These countries have influences from Arabic, Persian, and Indian cultures.
    Incidentally Pakistan also borders China in the same way that Sumeru borders Liyue.
    Of course, the geocultural region corresponding to Sumeru is quite vast
    to say that any single country can represent it all.
