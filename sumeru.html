<title>Sumeru</title>

  <h2>Sumeru</h2>
  <p>Although it was clear that Inazuma corresponds to Japan,
    people debate what exactly Sumeru corresponds to in the real world.  
  </p>
  <p>Based on the given information from versions 1 and 2,
    Sumeru appears to correspond to the geographic region
    spanning as far east as India and as far west as North Africa.
    Some say it corresponds to the so called SWANA region,
    encompassing Southwest Asia and North Africa.
    Although this vast territory roughly coincides with the Islamic world,
    not everything in Sumeru is based on Islamic influences.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, Sumeru also has some Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain influences,
    corresponding to the South Asian region.
    In Chinese, Sumeru is called 须弥 which is a Buddhist term referring to Mount Meru.
    Some people identify Mount Meru as being located in the Pamir mountains or Kashmir.
    This corresponds to a land at the confluence of China, Central Asia, and South Asia.
    But geographically, if Liyue represents China, then Sumeru represents what is west of China.
  </p>
  <p>
    The names of some Sumeru NPCs also point to Persian influences as well in the region.
    There also appear to be Arabic influences in Sumeru as well.
    Some speculate that Cyno, who was featured in the Teyvat trailer,
    is based on Egyptian culture.
  </p><p>
    It should be noted that North Africa, the Levant, West Asia, Persia, and India
    all had their own cultures and histories before the Islamic Arabic empires that rose during the 7th century and after.
    Egypt has thousands of years of history before Islam.
    Persia also has its own history with the Persian Empire and Hellenic culture before the Arabs arrived.
    And of course South Asia and India has thousands of years of history with Buddhism and Hinduism before Islam arrived to the subcontinent.
    Even the Mesopotamia region, one of the oldest cradles of civilization, between the Tigris and Euphrates, existed long before Islam.
    The Phoenicians also ruled North Africa before the Arabs came.
    So to encompass such a vast region with distinct histories and cultures is quite a task.
  </p><p>
    Also whereas Mondstadt, Liyue, and Inazuma may be united by a similar language and culture,
    what is the common theme that binds Sumeru together?
    If one looks at SWANA, there are at least 2-4 distinct language families comprising the region:
    the Afro-Asiatic (Semitic) languages with Arabic being dominant
    and the Indo-Aryan languages (including Farsi, Hindustani, etc).
    If one wants to include even more of the Indian subcontinent, then Dravidian would be another family.
    But there is even one more language family: the Turkic languages
    as the region from India, Iran, to North Africa and West Asia
    has also seen the rise of various Turkic Islamic empires
    such as the Seljuk, Timurid, Mughal, and Ottoman empires.
  </p><p>
    If there is any one thing binding such a huge and diverse region together,
    it would probably be a shared history and culture of Islam.
    That is including as far west as Al-Andalus (Muslim Spain)
    and other parts of Europe that were at some point ruled by Muslims,
    whether via Berbers, Arabs, or other groups.
  </p>
  <p>
    If there is a single country in the world that could be said to incorporate influences from all these various cultures,
    it would probably be Pakistan or even Afghanistan.
    These countries have influences from Arabic, Persian, and Indian cultures.
    Incidentally Pakistan also borders China in the same way that Sumeru borders Liyue.
    Of course, the geocultural region corresponding to Sumeru is quite vast
    to say that any single country can represent it all.
  </p>

  <h2>Dendro and wisdom</h2>
  <p>Sumeru is the nation of wisdom, called prajna in Sanskrit. 
    Wisdom itself is an important topic in the religions of Hinduism, Buddhism, etc. found in the Indian subcontinent.
  </p>

  <h2>Climate</h2>
  <p>The 2.8 trailer provided a glimpse at Sumeru, featuring tropical greenery, rainforests, palm trees by the sea, etc.
    Another Sumeru trailer video showcased that Sumeru has both the tropical rainforests and vast deserts.
    The desert sands are located to Sumeru's west.
    These are similar to the dry climate, deserts and mountains that span Northwest India,
    Pakistan, Iran, and the Middle East and North Africa (including the Maghreb and Sahara).
    The rainforests seem to resemble the geography of tropical India a bit more.
    The tropical climate also appears to correspond to the monsoon climate of India as well.
    But such greenery is also seen near the banks of the Tigris-Euphrates around Iraq and the Nile river around Egypt.
    So the climate and biome seem to take some inspiration from the vast SWANA region.
  </p>

  <h2>Script</h2>
  <p>
    Within this vast SWANA region, there are two main types of scripts used:
    the Arabic script including its variants used in Iran, Pakistan, etc.
    and the Brahmic/Vedic family of scripts, including Devanagari (used for Sanskrit) and its many many variants, etc.
  </p>

  <h2>Music</h2>
  <p>
    The music (as presented in the trailers showed so far) also has influences from the SWANA region.
  </p>

  <h2>China and the West</h2>
  <p>
    It should be noted that even in the Arabic classic, Aladdin lives in a city of China (probably around western China and Central Asia).
    This is to illustrate the sheer expanse of territory encompassing this cultural region.
    During the Mongol Empire, the region from China to West Asia was indeed unified in a single empire.
    The ties between China and the west go back millennia,
    from Buddhism during the Han,
    Islam during the Tang,
    the Mongol Empire,
    and so on.
  </p><p>
    The 'west' also features prominently in Chinese culture and literature, particularly the story of Xuanzang's legendary journey to the west
    during the Tang dynasty. Xuanzang (Tang Sanzang), one of the most reputed Chinese Buddhists and translators in history, 
    embarked on his journey from Tang China through Central Asia to India (天竺)
    to collect and translate Buddhist scriptures, helping form much of the modern Buddhist canon in Chinese.
    The history between China and the West runs deep, in culture, religion, trade, knowledge along the Silk Road,
    just like how Liyue and Sumeru are connected in Teyvat.
