  The word "meta" can refer to the real meta or the fake meta.
  The real meta is an objective assessment of characters' strengths and weaknesses,
  including calculations of their DPS potential and other abilities.
  The fake meta refers to the lies promulgated by biased USA media, 
  including but not limited to the xenophobic factions of the CIA, FBI, NED, NDI,
  to serve the political agenda of the selected few within the USA.
  The fake meta believers present one sided views of topics,
  will deliberately lie in your face,
  and twist the truth to curry their favor.
  These guides are concerned with the real meta and often debunk many of the falsehoods promoted by USA fake news and its proxies.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="DPS_Calculations">DPS Calculations</span></h2>
<p>We assume that with artifact stats and weapons, all characters have similar ATK, Crit Rate, Crit Damage, etc. 
  Following calculations only focus on motion values / talent scalings.
  Below just gives some examples of dps calculations.
  See <a href='dps.html'>dps</a> and <a href='team-calc.html'>team calcs</a> for more details.
</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Xiao">Xiao</span></h3>
<p>Level 10 AA, Level 10 Q, High Plunge, no initial damage bonus
</p><p>\( 404*1.952\approx 788.6 \)
</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ganyu">Ganyu</span></h3>
<p>Level 10 AA, no initial damage bonus
</p><p>\( (230+392)/3=207.3 \)
</p><p>This is lower than Xiao's high plunge scaling.
</p>
<ul><li>Xiao also attacks faster than Ganyu's charged shots.</li>
<li>Also Xiao high plunges have larger AoE (6m radius) than Ganyu's charged shot blooms (5m radius).</li>
<li>Ganyu's charged shots are actually split into two parts (the first part can miss entirely).</li></ul>
<p>Conclusion:
</p>
<ul><li>Based on talent scaling, there is no way any Morgana team can outperform a simple Xiao-Bennett-Venti core team in DPS.</li>
<li>Even if you reduce Cryo resistance by 40% with Venti and Viridescent Venerer (from say 10% to -30% RES), that only gives a 1.15 RES multiplier meaning an MV of \(1.15*622\approx 715 \) which is still lower than Xiao. And even then the ATK buff from Bennett will widen the gap even further.</li></ul>
<p>This is only at C0. At C6, Xiao widens the gap even further.
</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pyro_DPS">Pyro DPS</span></h2>
<dl><dt>Diluc</dt></dl>
<p>Level 10 E, no initial damage bonus, no Xingqiu
</p><p>\(170+176+232=578\)
</p>
<dl><dt>Hu Tao</dt></dl>
<p>We assume that the HP to ATK buff gained will make Hu Tao's stats similar to other Pyro characters (given that Hu Tao has the lowest base ATK in the game).
</p><p>Level 10 Charged Attack, no initial damage bonus, no Xingqiu
</p><p>\( 243\)
</p><p>Conclusion:
</p>
<ul><li>Even if Hu Tao spams 2 charged attacks (MV becomes \(243*2=486\)) in the time it takes for Diluc to use his skill 3 times, Hu Tao's MV is still lower than Diluc's.</li></ul>
<p>Notes:
</p>
<ul><li>Rosaria has higher charged attack scaling than Hu Tao.</li>
<li>Diluc E and Hu Tao CA have no ICD (or short enough ICD) so they can react on every strike.</li>
<li>Hu Tao is very single target. Even Diluc's claymore swings cover a wider AoE without costing stamina.</li>
<li>Xingqiu is single target, which makes him an inferior support compared to characters with better AoE.</li>
<li>Hu Tao has negative synergy with Bennett, unlike other Pyro characters, which ultimately makes Hu Tao a worse DPS. Moreover, until Thoma's release, it was very hard for Hu Tao to take advantage of an Anemo VV shred.</li>
<li>Hu Tao has negative synergy with C6 Zhongli (who heals) and would rather prefer Thoma as a shielder.
<ul><li>Zhongli is best suited as a support for Xiao who benefits from the Anemo RES debuff. Morgana does not need Zhongli. Childe-Xiangling does not need Zhongli. Hu Tao-Thoma does not need Zhongli. If you just use Zhongli for a shield, you can just run Diona or Thoma. If you want to shred RES with Zhongli, for most characters you can just use Anemo VV or Superconduct to reduce RES even more. Really, only the Anemo DPS Xiao benefits from the Anemo RES shred that Zhongli provides (in the game, it is very hard to reduce Anemo RES). Furthermore, C6 Zhongli is basically built for Xiao as it counters the health drain from Xiao's ultimate.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>Other Pyro characters:
</p>
<ul><li>Yoimiya does not need Xingqiu and has the highest Normal Attack scaling among bow users. Overload Yoimiya with Raiden is one of her better teams.</li>
<li>Childe is better for Xiangling than Xingqiu. Xiangling's Pyronado also has no ICD and has a scaling of 201 on each swing at Level 10 (becomes 238 at Level 13), which is lower than Hu Tao's charged attack. But Pyronado is AoE, can snapshot, does not cost stamina, and Childe will do more damage for Xiangling than Xingqiu for Hu Tao. This makes a Childe-Xiangling team better than a Hu Tao-Xingqiu team in AoE situations. The fact that Childe-Xiangling can more easily use Bennett for the ATK buff and snapshotting as well as Sucrose or Kazuha for VV makes the team even better.</li></ul>
  
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Support_Tierlist">Support Tierlist</span></h2>
<p>Here, utility supports are units with off-field abilities that can benefit the team.
  For the longest time, Venti or Bennett were undisputably considered the top supports of the game.
  But since 3.2, Nahida can be said to have claimed the throne as best support in the game.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Nahida: Nahida long-lasting 100% uptime off-field aoe dendro application often makes her the best dendro support for quicken and bloom teams.
    Because of hyperbloom's insanely high dps, Nahida's value is god-level as the premium dendro sub-dps.
    Nahida also gives an EM buff with her burst and can do high sub-dps with her E.
  </li>
  <li>Venti: Should come as no surprise. Venti has been broken since the game's start. He may not work in every situation, but when he does work, he is a literal game-changer. Also, even with a Level 1 weapon and no artifacts, Venti will still do his job. This cannot be said about any other support. There is no way to powercreep the AoE CC Venti provides without releasing a Venti 2.0. Most future-proof support in game. Venti's burst can destroy mobs so quickly that it basically makes Venti a DPS character, and Venti does not even have to be on field.</li>
  <li>Bennett: Broken ATK buff, heals, can even solo an Electro Abyss Lector's shield. But does not work for every character like Hu Tao or every team (Morgana or other Freeze Team). Bennett C6 can also mess up some characters (like Eula). Hard to powercreep without releasing a 5 star version with better scaling (a Bennett 2.0 if you will).</li>
  <li>Raiden: provides good energy generation (though Venti can also refund energy too) and buffs bursts. Raiden's burst also can deal a lot of damage (more so at C2) that is also AoE. Raiden is optimal on a Eula team. Other than that, the utility she provides is not as broken or needed as some of the other characters on the list.</li>
  <li>Mona: has great AoE and an excellent burst that also provides a damage bonus. She has one of the strongest nukes in the game and provides cc immobilization and a taunt. Good for freeze teams. If Mona were Cryo, that would not necessarily be better as Mona's burst can do 2x vaporize damage (whereas a Cryo nuke only does 1.5x melt damage), and one still needs Hydro for Freeze teams. One can make a similar argument for why a "Cryo Childe" would not necessarily powercreep Childe.</li>
<li>Mona, Yelan, Raiden (tied):
<ul>

<li>Yelan is better than Xingqiu and can even provide dmg bonus of up to 50%.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Sucrose: like Venti can use the VV set to shred RES and provide good AoE CC. A C6 Sucrose is better than C0 Kazuha because Sucrose can use Thrilling Tales. It is just that Sucrose set the bar very high and is vastly underrated as a support.</li>
<li>Xingqiu is only useful for two characters Diluc and Hu Tao. In almost every other situation, he is not needed or can be replaced by another Hydro character. Xingqiu is overrated and very single-target, whereas the other units above have much better AoE. Moreover, it is very easy to powercreep Xingqiu just by releasing a Cryo version of Xingqiu (to make the Pyro carries deal 2x damage instead of 1.5x).</li>
<li>Morax: Can shred RES and provide shield. C6 can even heal (which messes up characters like Hu Tao). But in end, really only provides defensive buff, whereas many other teams (Morgana, Hu Tao-Thoma, Childe-Xiangling) need more offense and do not need Zhongli. At C0, in terms of RES shred, Zhongli is powercrept by Viridescent Venerer or Superconduct for most elements except Anemo RES. Zhongli is best suited as a Xiao support. With the release of Deepwood, Zhongli fell even further out of the meta.</li>
<li>Kazuha: worse than Sucrose. At C6, Kazuha becomes more like Xiao and less like Sucrose/Venti.</li>
</ol>

<p>Notes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Childe is more an on-field "support" (or "enabler") whereas these other characters are more off-field supports.</li>
<li>Honorable Mentions: Barbara with Thrilling Tales and Jean are great healers and supports. Jean can also provide fall damage with her skill, and her burst can apply Anemo giving it interesting applications in removing debuffs and swirling Pyro with Bennett's burst.</li>
<li>As for which characters are most important: in the game you need both DPS and support characters. They are equally as important (and it can be argued that one needs a DPS character to clear all the content in the game). Supports come and go and can be replaced. It is subjective to say support characters are more important (those who say this are more biased towards support characters). Being able to use a character in every situation does not necessarily make them better. They may then be a jack of all trades and master of none.</li>
<li>Healers and Shielders are equally as important. In fact, it can be argued that healing is more necessary (especially with Corrosion). Those who say Shields are more important are biased towards Zhongli (or worse Baizhu). They are also the same people who think supports are more important and use math to mislead and fool the people.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Characters that do their job without really needing artifacts or weapons are:
  Chongyun (E infusion) and Childe (Hydro application through E).
</p>


<h2>Top buffers</h2>
<p>
  These are supports/buffs/drivers/enablers that increase the damage of others.
  The following factors are considered: how big the buff is, how widely applicable it is, 
  how easily achievable it is, how long it lasts (if there is any downtime).
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Faruzan (C6): for anemo dps only. Anemo res shred, dmg bonus, additive dmg, crit dmg bonus makes her a model buffer.
    She buffs anemo in nearly every possible way.
  </li>
  <li>Tie:
    <ul>
    <li>Yun Jin: 1.5-2 times damage for NA only</li>
    <li>Shenhe: 1.5-2 times damage for Cryo only, has quota of 5/7, unless have C6</li>
    <li>Bennett: 1.5 times damage for ATK-scaling characters (most characters), applies to all attacks, heals</li>
  </ul>
</li>
  <li>Childe: 1.5 times reaction damage (for vaporize), no energy cost</li>
  <li>Yelan, Xingqiu, Xiangling: 1.5 times reaction damage (for vaporize/melt), high energy cost of 80</li>
  <li>Viridescent Venerer, Superconduct: around 1.28 times damage (-40% RES)</li>
  <li>Deepwood: around 1.22 times damage, -30% dendro res in between VV and Morax</li>
  <li>Zhongli/Geo resonance: around 1.17 times damage (-20% RES); even though it has 100% uptime and applies to everything, it is also the lowest numerical buff on the list; this is the game's way of balancing things, but then one remembers that the game did not exactly balance broken da broken Bennett</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Chongyun can enable Xiangling to melt several of her Pyronado hits.
    However, there is currently no Cryo support that can enable ON-field Pyro carries to melt on every hit efficiently
    (there is no Cryo Xingqiu/Childe).
    There is Xiangling as an off-field Pyro applicator (with no ICD on Pyronado), 
    but there is no Hydro DPS that can vaporize every hit
    (unless you play as charged attack Mona, Childe, etc. on Xiangling's Pyronado
    but that's not really the focus of their kit).
    Otherwise we would have a buffer that can enable 2 times melt/vaporize damage.
    Such a character would be at Yun Jin-Shenhe level on this list
    since although the buff is big, it would only apply to certain Pyro or Hydro characters.
  </p><p>
    Note most of the above buffs do not apply to transformative reactions
    (which are buffed by certain artifacts effects, EM, etc.).
