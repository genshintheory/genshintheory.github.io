  The word "meta" can refer to the real meta or the fake meta.
  The real meta is an objective assessment of characters' strengths and weaknesses,
  including calculations of their DPS potential and other abilities.
  The fake meta refers to the lies promulgated by biased USA media, 
  including but not limited to the xenophobic factions of the CIA, FBI, NED, NDI,
  to serve the political agenda of the selected few within the USA.
  The fake meta believers present one sided views of topics,
  will deliberately lie in your face,
  and twist the truth to curry their favor.
  These guides are concerned with the real meta and often debunk many of the falsehoods promoted by USA fake news and its proxies.
  </p><p>
    The objective of the USA CIA, NED, etc. is to monitor media across the world
    so that only people with certain surnames are the ones with the loudest voices
    and only people with certain surnames are allowed to have a free voice and comment on the art and science of Genshin or other things in the world.
    The only people allowed to innovate or participate in political discussions can only have certain surnames.
    The only people allowed to make key decisions and policies can only have certain surnames or be from certain groups.
    Meanwhile, everybody else will be attacked, harassed, purged, overthrown via the USA water army or color revolutions.
    After that, the USA media will go on a huge propaganda campaign to make those they overthrew look bad while those they kept in look good.
    The USA seeks to create a culture where only certain people are included and can win, while everybody else are kicked out and have to lose.
    While the state can play a big role in guiding the development and innovation and harnessing vast resources,
    what the USA does is akin to suffocation, something that damages people, society, and culture.
  </p><p>
    The USA NGOs and other governmental organizations attempts to purge all organizations, corporations, etc.
    of people who have different surnames and create a narrow-minded culture that only includes certain people while excluding the rest, 
    while serving the interests of USA hegemony.
    The CIA seeks to control the human resources, the flow of people in and out of organizations, as well as the succession process.
    As a result, most of USA media is a play, an act orchestrated by the USA government, with all the world as a stage,
    for the entertainment of the USA elites and their overseas proxies.
    The purpose of waging war on others is to force people across the world to stick to the USA-engineered script,
    to submit and conform to the whims of the USA imperialists.
  </p>
  <p>In conclusion, one must never listen to USA media 100%. 
    USA media is biased and highly tailored towards political objectives of USA elites.
    Those who buy into USA media are either the elites creating it themselves or fools who want to be used by the USA.
    Second, the fools who want to side with the USA either because they are bribed by the elites 
    or because they actually cannot think for themselves need to be punished severely.
    Third, whatever USA media says, do the opposite. This is the creed the CIA follows when fighting their enemies.
    Whatever the enemy does, do the opposite.
    The USA government does not serve their own people. They put the interests of foreigners and their overseas wars above their own people.
    The USA elites need to be overthrown and disabled, revoked of all their power and influence over the world.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="DPS_Calculations">DPS Calculations</span></h2>
<p>We assume that with artifact stats and weapons, all characters have similar ATK, Crit Rate, Crit Damage, etc. 
  Following calculations only focus on motion values / talent scalings.
  Below just gives some examples of dps calculations.
  See <a href='dps.html'>dps</a> and <a href='team-calc.html'>team calcs</a> for more details.
</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Xiao">Xiao</span></h3>
<p>Level 10 AA, Level 10 Q, High Plunge, no initial damage bonus
</p><p>\( 404*1.952\approx 788.6 \)
</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ganyu">Ganyu</span></h3>
<p>Level 10 AA, no initial damage bonus
</p><p>\( (230+392)/3=207.3 \)
</p><p>This is lower than Xiao's high plunge scaling.
</p>
<ul><li>Xiao also attacks faster than Ganyu's charged shots.</li>
<li>Also Xiao high plunges have larger AoE (6m radius) than Ganyu's charged shot blooms (5m radius).</li>
<li>Ganyu's charged shots are actually split into two parts (the first part can miss entirely).</li></ul>
<p>Conclusion:
</p>
<ul><li>Based on talent scaling, there is no way any Morgana team can outperform a simple Xiao-Bennett-Venti core team in DPS.</li>
<li>Even if you reduce Cryo resistance by 40% with Venti and Viridescent Venerer (from say 10% to -30% RES), that only gives a 1.15 RES multiplier meaning an MV of \(1.15*622\approx 715 \) which is still lower than Xiao. And even then the ATK buff from Bennett will widen the gap even further.</li></ul>
<p>This is only at C0. At C6, Xiao widens the gap even further.
</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pyro_DPS">Pyro DPS</span></h2>
<dl><dt>Diluc</dt></dl>
<p>Level 10 E, no initial damage bonus, no Xingqiu
</p><p>\(170+176+232=578\)
</p>
<dl><dt>Hu Tao</dt></dl>
<p>We assume that the HP to ATK buff gained will make Hu Tao's stats similar to other Pyro characters (given that Hu Tao has the lowest base ATK in the game).
</p><p>Level 10 Charged Attack, no initial damage bonus, no Xingqiu
</p><p>\( 243\)
</p>

<p>Conclusion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Even if Hu Tao spams 2 charged attacks (MV becomes \(243*2=486\)) in the time it takes for Diluc to use his skill 3 times, Hu Tao's MV is still lower than Diluc's.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rosaria has higher charged attack scaling than Hu Tao.</li>
<li>Diluc E and Hu Tao CA have no ICD (or short enough ICD) so they can react on every strike.</li>
<li>Hu Tao is very single target. Even Diluc's claymore swings cover a wider AoE without costing stamina.</li>
<li>Xingqiu is single target, which makes him an inferior support compared to characters with better AoE.</li>
<li>Hu Tao has negative synergy with Bennett, unlike other Pyro characters, which ultimately makes Hu Tao a worse DPS. Moreover, until Thoma's release, it was very hard for Hu Tao to take advantage of an Anemo VV shred.</li>
<li>Hu Tao has negative synergy with C6 Zhongli (who heals) and would rather prefer Thoma as a shielder.
<ul>
  <li>Zhongli is best suited as a support for Xiao who benefits from the Anemo RES debuff. Morgana does not need Zhongli. Childe-Xiangling does not need Zhongli. Hu Tao-Thoma does not need Zhongli. If you just use Zhongli for a shield, you can just run Diona or Thoma. If you want to shred RES with Zhongli, for most characters you can just use Anemo VV or Superconduct to reduce RES even more. Really, only the Anemo DPS Xiao benefits from the Anemo RES shred that Zhongli provides (in the game, it is very hard to reduce Anemo RES). Furthermore, C6 Zhongli is basically built for Xiao as it counters the health drain from Xiao's ultimate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Other Pyro characters:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Yoimiya has the highest Normal Attack scaling among bow users. 
    For Yoimiya, Yelan or XQ act as sub-dps rather than vape enablers.
    Vapeload (fireworks) Yoimiya with Yelan-Raiden/Yae is viable.
    The thing with overload is that it is a symmetric reaction (either pyro or electro can proc it),
    so one needs to be careful on whose EM is being factored into the calculation.
  </li>
<li>Childe is better for Xiangling than Xingqiu. Xiangling's Pyronado also has no ICD and has a scaling of 201 on each swing at Level 10 (becomes 238 at Level 13), which is lower than Hu Tao's charged attack. But Pyronado is AoE, can snapshot, does not cost stamina, and Childe will do more damage for Xiangling than Xingqiu for Hu Tao. This makes a Childe-Xiangling team better than a Hu Tao-Xingqiu team in AoE situations. The fact that Childe-Xiangling can more easily use Bennett for the ATK buff and snapshotting as well as Sucrose or Kazuha for VV makes the team even better.</li>
</ul>
