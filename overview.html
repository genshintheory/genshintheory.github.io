<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="DPS_Calculations">DPS Calculations</span></h2>
<p>We assume that with artifact stats and weapons, all characters have similar ATK, Crit Rate, Crit Damage, etc. Following calculations only focus on motion values / talent scalings.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Xiao">Xiao</span></h3>
<p>Level 10 AA, Level 10 Q, High Plunge, no initial damage bonus
</p><p>\( 404*1.952\approx 788.6 \)
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ganyu">Ganyu</span></h3>
<p>Level 10 AA, no initial damage bonus
</p><p>\( 230+392=622\)
</p><p>This is lower than Xiao's high plunge scaling.
</p>
<ul><li>Xiao also attacks faster than Ganyu's charged shots.</li>
<li>Also Xiao high plunges have larger AoE (6m radius) than Ganyu's charged shot blooms (5m radius).</li>
<li>Ganyu's charged shots are actually split into two parts (the first part can miss entirely).</li></ul>
<p>Conclusion:
</p>
<ul><li>Based on talent scaling, there is no way any Morgana team can outperform a simple Xiao-Bennett-Venti core team in DPS.</li>
<li>Even if you reduce Cryo resistance by 40% with Venti and Viridescent Venerer (from say 10% to -30% RES), that only gives a 1.15 RES multiplier meaning an MV of <img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/png/d52bc3787c171c17591fa793b233d66c4d9b0f73" class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline" aria-hidden="true" style="vertical-align: -0.338ex; width:16.402ex; height:2.176ex;" alt="{\displaystyle 1.15*622\approx 715}" /> which is still lower than Xiao. And even then the ATK buff from Bennett will widen the gap even further.</li></ul>
<p>This is only at C0. At C6, Xiao widens the gap even further.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pyro_DPS">Pyro DPS</span></h2>
<dl><dt>Diluc</dt></dl>
<p>Level 10 E, no initial damage bonus, no Xingqiu
</p><p>\(170+176+232=578\)
</p>
<dl><dt>Hu Tao</dt></dl>
<p>We assume that the HP to ATK buff gained will make Hu Tao's stats similar to other Pyro characters (given that Hu Tao has the lowest base ATK in the game).
</p><p>Level 10 Charged Attack, no initial damage bonus, no Xingqiu
</p><p>\( 243\)
</p><p>Conclusion:
</p>
<ul><li>Even if Hu Tao spams 2 charged attacks (MV becomes \(243*2=486\)) in the time it takes for Diluc to use his skill 3 times, Hu Tao's MV is still lower than Diluc's.</li></ul>
<p>Notes:
</p>
<ul><li>Rosaria has higher charged attack scaling than Hu Tao.</li>
<li>Diluc E and Hu Tao CA have no ICD (or short enough ICD) so they can react on every strike.</li>
<li>Hu Tao is very single target. Even Diluc's claymore swings cover a wider AoE without costing stamina.</li>
<li>Xingqiu is single target, which makes him an inferior support compared to characters with better AoE.</li>
<li>Hu Tao has negative synergy with Bennett, unlike other Pyro characters, which ultimately makes Hu Tao a worse DPS. Moreover, until Thoma's release, it was very hard for Hu Tao to take advantage of an Anemo VV shred.</li>
<li>Hu Tao has negative synergy with C6 Zhongli (who heals) and would rather prefer Thoma as a shielder.
<ul><li>Zhongli is best suited as a support for Xiao who benefits from the Anemo RES debuff. Morgana does not need Zhongli. Childe-Xiangling does not need Zhongli. Hu Tao-Thoma does not need Zhongli. If you just use Zhongli for a shield, you can just run Diona or Thoma. If you want to shred RES with Zhongli, for most characters you can just use Anemo VV or Superconduct to reduce RES even more. Really, only the Anemo DPS Xiao benefits from the Anemo RES shred that Zhongli provides (in the game, it is very hard to reduce Anemo RES). Furthermore, C6 Zhongli is basically built for Xiao as it counters the health drain from Xiao's ultimate.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>Other Pyro characters:
</p>
<ul><li>Yoimiya does not need Xingqiu and has the highest Normal Attack scaling among bow users. Overload Yoimiya with Raiden is one of her better teams.</li>
<li>Childe is better for Xiangling than Xingqiu. Xiangling's Pyronado also has no ICD and has a scaling of <img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/png/278d5f2c7e980de648903c802691b67116dced05" class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline" aria-hidden="true" style="vertical-align: -0.338ex; width:3.487ex; height:2.176ex;" alt="{\displaystyle 201}" /> on each swing at Level 10 (becomes 238 at Level 13), which is lower than Hu Tao's charged attack. But Pyronado is AoE, can snapshot, does not cost stamina, and Childe will do more damage for Xiangling than Xingqiu for Hu Tao. This makes a Childe-Xiangling team better than a Hu Tao-Xingqiu team in AoE situations. The fact that Childe-Xiangling can more easily use Bennett for the ATK buff and snapshotting as well as Sucrose or Kazuha for VV makes the team even better.</li></ul>
  
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Weapon_Tierlist">Weapon Tierlist</span></h2>
<ol><li>Staff of Homa: great stats and passive, very good on all polearm users and BiS for many (Hu Tao, even Xiao under 50% HP)</li>
<li>Thundering Pulse: great stats similar to Homa, good on many bow users (Yoimiya, Childe), passive is less simple than the Homa</li>
<li>Skyward Harp, Primordial Jade Spear (tied): solid stats, good on many characters, may not be BiS for every character</li></ol>
<p>Weapons like Stringless, Elegy, Amos are really only good on one specific character, so they do not rank as highly.
</p><p>As of Version 2.2, Wolf's Gravestone is the most solid claymore, but its substat is ATK%, and the game does not have any great 5 star CRIT claymores.
</p><p>The Primordial Jade Cutter has great 44% Crit Rate substat (but low base attack), but most sword users are supports and would prefer a different weapon. Moreover, the sword DPS users in the game are underwhelming, making it hard to justify pulling on the Jade Cutter alone.
</p><p>Most catalysts in the game are underwhelming. The Widsith and Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds are decent. But based on how most catalysts are supports, oftentimes the best catalyst is the Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Support_Tierlist">Support Tierlist</span></h2>
<p>Here, utility supports are units with off-field abilities that can benefit the team.
</p>
<ol><li>Venti: Should come as no surprise. Venti has been broken since the game's start. He may not work in every situation, but when he does work, he is a literal game-changer. Also, even with a Level 1 weapon and no artifacts, Venti will still do his job. This cannot be said about any other support. There is no way to powercreep the AoE CC Venti provides without releasing a Venti 2.0. Most future-proof support in game. Venti's burst can destroy mobs so quickly that it basically makes Venti a DPS character, and Venti does not even have to be on field.</li>
<li>Bennett: Broken ATK buff, heals, can even solo an Electro Abyss Lector's shield. But does not work for every character like Hu Tao or every team (Morgana or other Freeze Team). Bennett C6 can also mess up some characters (like Eula). Hard to powercreep without releasing a 5 star version with better scaling (a Bennett 2.0 if you will).</li>
<li>Zhongli: Close to Bennett in terms of utility. Can shred RES and provide shield. C6 can even heal (which messes up characters like Hu Tao). But in end, really only provides defensive buff, whereas many other teams (Morgana, Hu Tao-Thoma, Childe-Xiangling) need more offense and do not need Zhongli. At C0, in terms of RES shred, Zhongli is powercrept by Viridescent Venerer or Superconduct for most elements except Anemo RES. Zhongli is best suited as a Xiao support.</li>
<li>Sucrose, Kazuha (tied): in terms of support utility, the two are close and like Venti can use the VV set to shred RES and provide good AoE CC. A C6 Sucrose may have a slight advantage over a C0 Kazuha because Sucrose can use Thrilling Tales. But in terms of sub-DPS, Kazuha will do more damage, and it becomes more apparent at higher constellations, which bring Kazuha closer to (and even surpass) Zhongli level. At C6, Kazuha becomes more like Xiao and less like Sucrose/Venti. Kazuha is a solid top-tier support. It is just that Sucrose set the bar very high and is vastly underrated as a support.</li>
<li>Xingqiu, Mona, Raiden (tied):
<ul><li>Xingqiu is only essential for two characters Diluc and Hu Tao. In almost every other situation, he is not needed or can be replaced by another Hydro character. Xingqiu is somewhat overrated and very single-target, whereas the other units above have much better AoE. Moreover, it is very easy to powercreep Xingqiu just by releasing a Cryo version of Xingqiu (to make the Pyro carries deal 2x damage instead of 1.5x).</li>
<li>Mona has great AoE and an excellent burst that also provides a damage bonus. She is more a top-tier sub-DPS / burst support / nuke than the other characters here (utility supports) but is included on the list because of her off-field support utility as well. Good for freeze teams. If Mona were Cryo, that would not necessarily be better as Mona's burst can do 2x vaporize damage (whereas a Cryo nuke only does 1.5x melt damage), and one still needs Hydro for Freeze teams. One can make a similar argument for why a "Cryo Childe" would not necessarily powercreep Childe.</li>
<li>Raiden provides good energy generation (though Venti can also refund energy too) and buffs bursts. Raiden's burst also can deal a lot of damage (more so at C2) that is also AoE. Raiden is optimal on a Eula team. Other than that, the utility she provides is not as broken or needed as some of the other characters on the list.</li></ul></li></ol>
<p>Notes:
</p>
<ul><li>Childe is more an on-field "support" (or "enabler") whereas these other characters are more off-field supports.</li>
<li>Honorable Mentions: Barbara with Thrilling Tales and Jean are great healers and supports. Jean can also provide fall damage with her skill, and her burst can apply Anemo giving it interesting applications in removing debuffs and swirling Pyro with Bennett's burst.</li>
<li>As for which characters are most important: in the game you need both DPS and support characters. They are equally as important (and it can be argued that one needs a DPS character to clear all the content in the game). Supports come and go and can be replaced. It is subjective to say support characters are more important (those who say this are more biased towards support characters). Being able to use a character in every situation does not necessarily make them better. They may then be a jack of all trades and master of none.</li>
<li>Healers and Shielders are equally as important. In fact, it can be argued that healing is more necessary (especially with Corrosion). Those who say Shields are more important are biased towards Zhongli. They are also the same people who think supports are more important and use math to mislead and fool the people.</li></ul>
