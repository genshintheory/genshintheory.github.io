  <p>If curry is a national dish of Sumeru,
    then there is some connection between Sumeru and India,
    a civilization that has historically had very deep ties with China.
    One of the greatest cultural ties between China and India is the religion of Buddhism,
    spread along the Silk Road 2000 years ago.
    Nowadays, Buddhism is mostly found in China and other parts of East Asia.
    But even in modern times, Hinduism still retains many similarities with Buddhism,
    so it would be a mistake to say that Buddhism has disappeared from India.
    Rather, it lives on in India via Hinduism.
  </p>


  <h2>The Indus civilization</h2>
  <p>The Indus River Valley is one of the original cradles of civilization (the others being China, Sumer, Egypt).
    The first script appeared around 2700 bc and is known as the Harappan script.
    It remains undeciphered to this day.
    It was used from 2700-1900 bc.
    Around 2000 bc, the Aryans started settling into north India, bringing with them the Vedic Sanskrit and religion.
    Sanskrit (梵语) is associated with some of the oldest scripture of the Vedic and Hindu canon.
    Hindu is from the name Sindhu, referring to the Indus river valley.
    The change from the s to h sound occurred around 800 bc.
  </p><p>
    The Vedas (Rigveda, etc.) were composed between 1500-800 bc and passed down via oral tradition.
    Some famous scriptures such as the Mahabharata and Bhagavad Gita were composed around 400 bc.
  </p><p>
    The term Vedas means knowledge, suiting how Sumeru is the land of knowledge.
    It is cognate with words like verify, veritas in European languages.
    The corpus of similar words between European and Indian languages has led several linguistic scholars
    to hypothesize that there is a common origin and that the 'Aryan' people are the ancestors of many Europeans and Indians today.
    Taking this one step further, there are many cognates and linguistic similarities between these 'Aryan' languages and Chinese languages,
    suggesting a common root for 'Sino-Aryan' languages.
  </p><p>
    For example, the Andronovo culture spanning Central Asia and West China
    is thought to be one of the origins of the Aryan people.
    The connection between the Aryan people and China does not get any more obvious than this.
  </p>


  <h3>Oldest deciphered writing: Edicts of Ashoka and Tamil literature</h3>
  <p>
    The first deciphered writing of India appeared around 250 bc with the Edicts of Ashoka
    as well as Tolkaappiyam (written in Tamil).
    Ashoka was the third emperor of the Mauryan/Chandragupta empire
    and grandson of the founder Chandragupta.
    Today, Ashoka's Chakra (wheel) is adopted as a symbol in the Indian national flag.
    Ashoka is credited with spreading Buddhism throughout Asia along the Silk Road.
  </p><p>
    The Edicts contained inscriptions in the Prakti, Aramaic, and Greek languages (from Alexander's empire).
    They were carved in stones and pillars scattered throughout Nepal, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh.
  </p><p>
    The Prakti language was written in the Brahmi script (an abugida), the ancestor of most scripts now used in India and Southeast Asia 
    (including the Devanagari script) as well as the Kharosthi script (used from India to Central Asia before going extinct).
  </p><p>
    The Edicts also feature the Hindu-Arabic numeric system,
    which would later be spread through the works of Persian mathematician Al-Khwarizmi, inventor of algebra and algorithm,
    as well as Arab Abbasid mathematician Al-Kindi (Abu Yousuf Ya'qub ibn 'Ishaq as-Sabbah al-Kindi).
    The number system used in the USA, Europe, and most of the world is based on the Hindu-Arabic numerals.
    There are some places in the world that retain their own versions of the number system (the Middle East / Persia, China, India, etc).
  </p><p>
    The Edicts also cover a lot of other topics, such as the Bodhi tree and Buddhism.

  </p>

  <p>
    The Tolkaappiaym is one of the oldest extant works of classical Tamil literature.
    Tamil is part of the Dravidian languages of South India, 
    and these are different from the Indo-Aryan languages of the north (Sanskrit, Hindustani, etc).
    It is believed that the Dravidian and Tamil culture has a longer history in India (and is native to India)
    whereas the Indo-Aryans and Sanskrit of the north is a more recent invasion into the subcontinent.
  </p>


  <h3>The question of indigenous origin</h3>
  <p>Prakrit is an Indo-Aryan language descended from Sanskrit.
    Some have raised the paradox on how Prakrit inscriptions (Ashoka's Edicts)
    appear many centuries before the first known Sanskrit inscriptions.
    Perhaps such inscriptions were destroyed in war or maybe not discovered yet.
    To draw an analogy, to this day, many archaeological discoveries are still being made on China's ancient history
    (oracle bones, jiaguwen, and writing far before then).
    Perhaps many more discoveries are yet to be made on India's ancient history.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, it is unknown what happened between 1900 bc (the Harappan script) and 250 bc 
    (appearance of first deciphered writing in India and Ashoka's Edicts).
    But this time period corresponds to the Indo-Aryan invasion and introduction of Vedic Sanskrit and Hinduism.
  </p><p>
    There is a debate on whether the Brahmic scripts of India have an indigenous origin
    or were descended from Egyptian hieroglyphs (via Phoenician and Aramaic).
    Note the Greek alphabet descends from Phoenician.
    Western scholars point out the many similarities in letters between Aramaic and Brahmi,
    deducing that Brahmi was influenced by Aramaic.
  </p><p>
    Other scholars posit that the Indian scripts were invented independently of other civilizations.
    Perhaps one can hypothesize that between 1900-250 bc, the Brahmic script evolved naturally from the Harappan script.
    And perhaps one day, if enough archaeological work is done,
    maybe one can find Sanskrit and Tamil inscriptions dating before the time of Ashoka. 
    It could even be that the Brahmi script combined a possible indigenous script with Aramaic, Phoenician, and Greek influences.
  </p><p>
    But currently there is not enough evidence to suggest how the Indian script evolved if it had an independent origin.
    We just do not know what scripts existed in India between 1900-250 bc.
    So the current evidence of the similarities between Aramaic and Brahmi favors a relationship between the two.
    As of now, this remains an unsolved problem in historical linguistics.
  </p>
  

  <h3>Connection with Ancient Persia and Greece</h3>
  <p>The earliest writing for the Persian language is the Behistun inscription (522 bc)
    from the time of Darius' rule during the Achaemenid empire founded by Cyrus.
    Cyrus conquered as far east as the Indus valley (in 535 bc), establishing Persian influence in northwest India.
    Alexander's Hellenic empire then succeeded the Achaemenid empire and reached the borders of northwest India.
    These would eventually be succeded by several Greco-Buddhist kingdoms in Central Asia and northwest India
    such as the Greco-Bactrian kingdom, Indo-Greek kingdoms, Dayuan (Ionians), Northern Satraps.
    And these would be absorbed into either Chandragupta's empire, the Kushan empire, or the Han dynasty of China.
  </p><p>
    Satrap is a term referring to governor.
    It was used during the Median and Achaemenid empires of Persia,
    and it was used by their successor states: Alexander's empire and the Sassanid empire.
  </p>


  <h2>Chandragupta's empire: Mora and Morax</h2>
  <p>
    Chandragupta Maurya founded the vast Mauryan empire around 320 bc, 
    covering much of the Indian subcontinent (and one of the largest empires in South Asian history).
    Chandragupta along with his teacher (acharya) Chanakya overthrew the Nanda empire to found the Mauryan empire.
    Chandragupta then defeated the satraps of northwest India and the Seleucids that were the remnants of Alexander's empire
    and expanded the empire's territory to Afghanistan and Balochistan (Pakistan).
    Chandragupta was known as chakravartin or universal ruler (similar to the title of Genghis Khan 成吉思汗).
  </p><p>
    Buddhist and Tamil texts mention that Chandragupta was from the Moriya clan of the Shakyas tribe,
    the same tribe that Gautama Buddha belonged to.    
    Indeed during Chandragupta's empire (322 BCE – 184 BCE), Buddhism was spread throughout the continent,
    reaching as far west as Persia, as far north as Central Asia and the Eurasian steppe, and as far east as China.
  </p><p>
    Moriya were also known as Maurya and lived in a region with many peacocks, known as Mora in Pali.
    Hence Moriya/Maurya/Mora is written as 孔雀 in Chinese, and Chandragupta's empire is referred to as the 孔雀帝国 or Mora/Peacock empire.
    This gives a new spin on the Mora and Morax of Genshin Impact, as something that originates from Chandragupta's ancient empire.
    Perhaps Chandragupta can be thought of as an incarnation of Morax then,
    giving a new look on Vago Mundo (尘世闲游).
