  <p>If curry is a national dish of Sumeru,
    then there is some connection between Sumeru and India,
    a civilization that has historically had very deep ties with China.
    One of the greatest cultural ties between China and India is the religion of Buddhism,
    spread along the Silk Road 2000 years ago.
    Nowadays, Buddhism is mostly found in China and other parts of East Asia.
    But even in modern times, Hinduism still retains many similarities with Buddhism,
    so it would be a mistake to say that Buddhism has disappeared from India.
    Rather, it lives on in India via Hinduism.

  <h2>The Indus civilization</h2>
  <p>The Indus River Valley is one of the original cradles of civilization (the others being China, Sumer, Egypt).
    The first script appeared around 2700 bc and is known as the Harappan script.
    It remains undeciphered to this day.
    It was used from 2700-1900 bc.
    Around 2000 bc, the Aryans started settling into north India, bringing with them the Vedic Sanskrit and religion.
    Sanskrit (梵语) is associated with some of the oldest scripture of the Vedic and Hindu canon.
    Hindu is from the name Sindhu, referring to the Indus river valley.
    The change from the s to h sound occurred around 800 bc.
  </p><p>
    The Vedas (Rigveda, etc.) were composed between 1500-800 bc and passed down via oral tradition.
    Some famous scriptures such as the Mahabharata and Bhagavad Gita were composed around 400 bc.
  </p><p>
    The term Vedas means knowledge, suiting how Sumeru is the land of knowledge.
    It is cognate with words like verify, veritas in European languages.
    The corpus of similar words between European and Indian languages has led several linguistic scholars
    to hypothesize that there is a common origin and that the 'Aryan' people are the ancestors of many Europeans and Indians today.
    Taking this one step further, there are many cognates and linguistic similarities between these 'Aryan' languages and Chinese languages,
    suggesting a common root for 'Sino-Aryan' languages.
  </p><p>
    The first deciphered writing of India appeared around 250 bc with the Edicts of Ashoka
    as well as Tolkaappiyam (written in Tamil).
    The Edicts were written in Prakti and contained inscriptions in Greek as well (Alexander's empire).
    They were written in ? script.
    Ashoka was the third emperor of the Mauryan/Chandragupta empire.
    The Tolkaappiaym is one of the oldest extant works of Tamil literature.
    Tamil is part of the Dravidian languages of South India, 
    and these are different from the Indo-Aryan languages of the north (Sanskrit, Hindustani, etc).    
  </p><p>
    Chandragupta Maurya founded the vast Mauryan empire around 320 bc, 
    covering much of the Indian subcontinent.
    Chandragupta along with his teacher (acharya) Chanakya overthrew the Nanda empire to found the Mauryan empire.
    Chandragupta then defeated the satraps of northwest India that were the remnants of Alexander's Hellenistic empire
    and expanded the empire's territory to Afghanistan and Balochistan (Pakistan).
    Buddhist and Tamil texts mention that Chandragupta was from the Moriya clan of the Shakyas tribe,
    the same tribe of Gautama Buddha.
    Indeed during Chandragupta's empire (322 BCE – 184 BCE), Buddhism was spread throughout the continent,
    reaching as far west as Persia, as far north as Central Asia and the Eurasian steppe, and as far east as China.
  </p>

  <p>The earliest writing for the Persian language is the Behistun inscription (522 bc)
    from the time of Darius' rule during the Achaemenid empire founded by Cyrus.
