  <p>If curry is a national dish of Sumeru,
    then there is some connection between Sumeru and India,
    a civilization that has historically had very deep ties with China.
    One of the greatest cultural ties between China and India is the religion of Buddhism,
    spread along the Silk Road 2000 years ago.
    Nowadays, Buddhism is mostly found in China and other parts of East Asia.
    But even in modern times, Hinduism still retains many similarities with Buddhism,
    so it would be a mistake to say that Buddhism has disappeared from India.
    Rather, it lives on in India via Hinduism.
