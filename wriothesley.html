<p>This is proof that Fontaine characters are based on other countries such as Britain, not just France.
</p><p>
  So it seems Azhdaha got promoted to administrator of Meropide.
  This is an example of career progression.
  Cyno / Jing Yuan could also benefit from career growth.

<h2>History: British empire and the East</h2>
<p>For the past 2000 years, China was usually always one of the most powerful,
  if not the most powerful civilization on Earth.
  The Han dynasty defeated the Huns, and the Huns would later cause the collapse of the Roman empire 
  (so one could say Liu Che essentially caused the collapse of the Roman empire).
  The Tang dynasty defeated the Gokturks, and the Turks would later conquer the west as well.
  And this culminated in the Mongol empire.
</p><p>
  However, the British empire is proof that a western empire can be more powerful in history.
  When Alexandrina Victoria defeated the Qing dynasty, she proved that she and the British empire were the strongest in the world at the time.
  This is something even the USA can admire.
  After all the USA could not even defeat Mao Zedong in the Korean or Vietnam wars.
  So the Anglo-Saxon countries are proof that western nations can be equal to or more powerful than eastern counterparts.  
</p><p>
  Look at what happened to the Qing in the 1800s.
  Alexandrina basically dominated the Qing during that century.
</p>

<h2>Enduring legacy of Pax Brittanica: building something that truly lasts</h2>
<p>
  Nowadays, 1 billion Chinese people learn English not Mongolian.
  So in this sense, the British empire seems to have had a more enduring impact on China than the Mongols.
  Why does Hong Kong exist in the first place?
  Why is English on the gaokao exam in China?
  Why do 1 billion people in China have to learn English anyways?
  All this can be traced back to Alexandrina Victoria.
</p><p>
  And this will continue for the foreseeable future:
  your children will learn English, your childrens' children will learn English.
  Many Chinese will continue to send their children to study overseas in the USA, Britain, and other English-speaking countries.
  This kind of legacy, if not godlike, can only be described as superhuman.
</p><p>
  The deep influence queen Alex had on China is hard to change.
  She continues to impact China to this day, even 200 years later.
  That is called true power and superhuman strength.
</p><p>
  It is harder for the USA to change this,
  so in a sense the USA is even more dominated by Alexandrina's legacy.
  What is the USA going to do? Change its official language to Spanish or Chinese?
  As long as the USA continues speak English and spread the English culture around the world, 
  it is living in Alexandrina's legacy and continuing to serve it.
