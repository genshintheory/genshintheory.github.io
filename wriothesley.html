<p>This is proof that Fontaine characters are based on other countries such as Britain, not just France.
</p><p>
  So it seems Azhdaha got promoted to administrator of Meropide.
  This is an example of career progression.
  Cyno / Jing Yuan could also benefit from career growth.
</p>

<h2>History: British empire and the East</h2>
<p>For the past 2000 years, China was usually always one of the most powerful,
  if not the most powerful civilization on Earth.
  The Han dynasty defeated the Huns, and the Huns would later cause the collapse of the Roman empire 
  (so one could say Liu Che essentially caused the collapse of the Roman empire).
  The Tang dynasty defeated the Gokturks, and the Turks would later conquer the west as well.
  And this culminated in the Mongol empire.
</p><p>
  However, the British empire is proof that a western empire can be more powerful in history.
  When Alexandrina Victoria defeated the Qing dynasty, she proved that she and the British empire were the strongest in the world at the time.
  This is something even the USA can admire.
  After all the USA could not even defeat Mao Zedong in the Korean or Vietnam wars.
  So the Anglo-Saxon countries are proof that western nations can be equal to or more powerful than eastern counterparts.  
</p><p>
  Look at what happened to the Qing in the 1800s.
  Alexandrina basically dominated the Qing during that century.
</p>

<h2>Enduring legacy of Pax Britannica: building something that truly lasts</h2>
<p>
  Nowadays, 1 billion Chinese people learn English not Mongolian.
  So in this sense, the British empire seems to have had a more enduring impact on China than the Mongols.
  Why does Hong Kong exist in the first place?
  Why is English on the gaokao exam in China?
  Why do 1 billion people in China have to learn English anyways?
  All this can be traced back to Alexandrina Victoria.
</p><p>
  And this will continue for the foreseeable future:
  your children will learn English, your childrens' children will learn English.
  Many Chinese will continue to send their children to study overseas in the USA, Britain, and other English-speaking countries.
  This kind of legacy, if not godlike, can only be described as superhuman.
</p><p>
  The deep influence queen Alex had on China is hard to change.
  She continues to impact China to this day, even 200 years later.
  That is called true power and superhuman strength.
</p><p>
  It is harder for the USA to change this,
  so in a sense the USA is even more dominated by Alexandrina's legacy.
  What is the USA going to do? Change its official language to Spanish or Chinese?
  As long as the USA continues to speak English and spread the English culture around the world, 
  it is living in Alexandrina's legacy and continuing to serve it.
</p><p>
  So in this sense, the USA is actually the biggest and most powerful guardian of Alexandrina's legacy.

<h2>Kit</h2>
<p>Wrio is the first cryo catalyst introduced in the game.</p>
<p>Similar to Ayaka, Wrio applies cryo fast, so he is not usually the one melting.
  Supports: Shenhe, anemo vv, Bennett, hydro applicator for freeze (Yelan, XQ, etc.), Mona, Dehya, Yun Jin, Thoma, XL.
</p><p>
  Kit seems similar to Scaramouche (E and Q).
  Q is a 5-hit nuke like Scaramouche.
  C2 gives dmg bonus to Q like Scaramouche.
</p><p>
  His E (Icefang Rush) lasts 10s with a 16s cd (so 6s of downtime).
  Moreover his E gives a multiplicative buff to his NA (chilling penalty state).
  So far, similar to Scaramouche (and the multiplier buff is also similar to Yoimiya).
  But Wrio's E will also cause his NA to drain HP every .1s.
  This is not Scaramouche.
</p><p>
  With his passive, when his hp dips below 60% during his E,
  his next CA (a sky uppercut) will deal 50% more dmg and heal 30% hp (gracious rebuke).
  This is actually quite unique among dps units.
  This effect occurs once per 5s, so this allows 2 buffed CA during his 10s E.
  He can use this buffed CA outside his E state too.
</p><p>
  His E state (chilling penalty) is indicated by a cryo wolf hovering near him.
</p><p>
  His other passive gives him 6% atk each time his hp changes during his E,
  up to 5 stacks for 30% atk buff.
</p>
<p>Scaramouche and Noctis have range on their attacks,
  whereas Wrio seems to be more of a close-range melee fighter,
  suiting his boxing background.
</p><p>
  Wrio is the British version of Scaramouche.
  (What's that supposed to mean?)
</p>

<h3>Constellations</h3>
<p></p>

<h3>Build</h3>
<p>Blizzard or Marechausse 4p can work.
  Blizzard is more for freeze, whereas Marechausse can work for melt.
  Other interesting options include Vermillion, Shimenawa, and other mixed sets.
</p><p>
  Do standard atk-cryo-crit.
  For substats: crit, atk, er, and maybe em if doing melt builds.
</p><p>
  For weapons, his signature Cashflow is good.
  Other options include Kagura, Eternal Flow (Aeon), Solar Pearl, Widsith, Toledo.
</p>


<h2>Calculations</h2>
<p>During his 10s E, he can do his 5-hit NA combo 3 times.
  So suppose in his 16s rotation, he does his full NA combo 3 times and 2 buffed CA.
</p>


<h2>Ship</h2>
<p>In the AQ, Wrio shows us a mega project he is working on:
  reconstructing a ship similar to Remus' Golden Fortuna to survive the flood.
  This combined with his role as Duke of Meropide shows his personal ambition as a 'self-made man'.
  When many Europeans migrated to the Americas or other overseas territories centuries before,
  many of them perhaps were seeking to fulfill their own ambitions and dreams (whether economic, spiritual, etc.) in a new land,
  away from the wars and other pushing factors at their home.
