<p>This is proof that Fontaine characters are based on other countries such as Britain, not just France.

  So it seems Azhdaha got promoted to administrator of Meropide.
  This is an example of career progression.
  Cyno / Jing Yuan could also benefit from career growth.

<h2>History: British empire and the East</h2>
<p>For the past 2000 years, China was usually always one of the most powerful,
  if not the most powerful civilization on Earth.
  The Han dynasty defeated the Huns, and the Huns would later cause the collapse of the Roman empire 
  (so one could say Liu Che essentially caused the collapse of the Roman empire).
  The Tang dynasty defeated the Gokturks, and the Turks would later conquer the west as well.
  And this culminated in the Mongol empire.
</p><p>
  However, the British empire is proof that a western empire can be more powerful in history.
  When Alexandrina Victoria defeated the Qing dynasty, she proved that she and the British empire were the strongest in the world at the time.
  This is something even the USA can admire.
  After all the USA could not even defeat Mao Zedong in the Korean or Vietnam wars.
  So the Anglo-Saxon countries are proof that western nations can be equal to or more powerful than eastern counterparts.

<p>
  Nowadays, 1 billion Chinese people learn English not Mongolian.
  So in this sense, the British empire seems to have had a more enduring impact on China than the Mongols.
  Why does Hong Kong exist in the first place?
  Why is English on the gaokao exam in China?
  Why do 1 billion people in China have to learn English anyways?
  All this can be traced back to Alexandrina Victoria.
  And this will continue for the foreseeable future:
  your children will learn English, your childrens' children will learn English.
  This kind of legacy, if not godlike, can only be described as superhuman.
