<title>Luocha</title>

<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  <h2>Automatic / reactive healing</h2>
  <p>
    Luocha tends to work favorably with the destruction path
    as well as characters that use a lot of follow-up attacks (Jing Yuan, Himeko, Svarog).
  </p>
  <p>The reactive healer: Luocha is a healer that reacts to when characters fall below a certain hp threshold.
    When he gains 2 stacks of abyss flower, he deploys a field. 
    When the field is active and characters deal damage, they heal the whole party.
    As of version 3.8, Luocha has no analog in Genshin.
    When Jean uses NA she can heal the whole party.
    When Mika uses his Q, he grants a similar effect where characters' NA heal the whole team.
    But there is currently no healer that has a Mika-like effect without needing Q (and that applies to whenever damage is dealt, not just NA).
  </p><p>
    A simple idea for making a Luocha analog (call it LC) in Genshin could be:
    whenever a character's hp falls below 33%, LC heals that character using whatever formula and gains 1 stack of abyss.
    This effect can be triggered once every 10-15s.
    Healing will also remove any debuff on that character (Genshin currently lacks as many debuffs as HSR).
    The E skill has a similar effect, providing healing to a chosen character
    (in Genshin one cannot usually select which character receives the healing, 
    but one can try to make an effect where the healing occurs after 2s to whichever character is on-field, giving time to switch to another character if needed;
    otherwise one can do a healing over time like Yaoyao / Barbara / Kuki E).
    Using E will also grant 1 stack of abyss.
    Once 2 stacks of abyss are obtained, LC will deploy a field / grant an effect to the team where whenever any party member deals damage, they heal the whole party.
    This effect can last 10-15s.
    And then LC's Q can debuff the enemy while dealing aoe damage.
  </p><p>
    Ok that's cool, but is there a need for this kind of healer when characters like kokomi and baizhu exist?
    Maybe.
  </p>

  <h2>Removing enemy buffs</h2>
  <p>
    Qiqi is unique in that she can reduce enemy atk. There are few abilities that do this in the game.
    However, HSR has several abilities (nihility class) that can debuff the enemy and remove their atk, dmg bonus buffs.
    Silver Wolf's basic attacks shred enemy def, atk, spd.
    Luocha's burst removes buffs from all enemies.
  </p><p>
    A simple idea for a support unit (nihility) in Genshin is someone who can reduce atk of enemies using E or Q at c0.
    This is similar to a kind of dmg reduction or def buff to the character.
  </p>


  <h2>Introducing more debuffs into Genshin</h2>
  <p>Every so often, elemental nodes appear in the abyss, granting buffs to certain enemies.
    These buffs could be removed by applying a suitable elemental gauge.
    In the past there used to be debuffs that would reduce character energy (electro) or extend their cd (hydro).
    These could be removed via certain abilities that apply an element to the character itself (thereby cleansing them).
    These include Xinyan E, Kirara E, etc.
    There was also once a corrosion debuff, one of the best things introduced into the game.
  </p>
  <p>These debuffs are some of the most interesting spiral abyss effects and made the game richer.
    One can introduce more kinds of debuffs such as atk reduction, def reduction, res shred, speed reduction.
    HSR has so many debuffs that can be applied to characters.
    Even Kafka can manipulate and make characters attack each other.
  </p>
  <p>Introducing more debuffs into Genshin can lead to more ideas for character roles,
    creating a demand for characters that can remove debuffs.
  </p>


  <h2>Eidolons</h2>
  <p>Luocha's eidolons are actually some of the best seen for a support in a while, combining harmony, preservation, and nihility.
    E1 makes field give atk buff.
    E2 allows Luocha skill to give a shield at a certain hp threshold (scaling with atk).
    E4 reduces enemy atk.
    E6 (the dust eidolon) makes burst reduce all enemy res by 20% (for 2 turns).
  </p><p>
    The E6 seems to nod to Morax in Genshin.
    The difference is Luocha needs E6 and burst energy cost, whereas Morax can just use his E and have 100% uptime.
    So it is not that Luocha's eidolons are broken, but that they flow and progress well for a support.
  </p><p>
    Now imagine creating a Morax-like preservation unit in Star Rail.
    Using skill gives all allies a shield that reduces all enemy res by 20%.
    And the shield lasts at least 2 turns.
    And then E6 is when shielded characters are hit they are healed.
