<title>Kaveh</title>

  </head>
  
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  <p>Kaveh (Kawei) went bankrupt because he smeared Alhaitham for no reason.
    As Alhaitham said, it does not matter how talented or not Kaveh is.
    Kaveh's flawed character ended up determining his destiny.
    Next time, Kaveh should learn to think before he speaks.
    If I were Alhaitham, I would also cancel funding for Kaveh's project.
  </p><p>
    In the context of Baizhu, Kaveh could be a reference to Wei Zhongxian, Hu Weiyong,
    or other enemies/victims of the Ming dynasty.

  <h2>Intro: Plebian Peddler</h2>
  <p>"I can't deny that he's very poor. However, it's a shame that a man of such hypocrisy only pays attention to the truth itself and not to the people around him. Or perhaps this is due to a lame sense of individualism, which causes a lot of problems. For example, he doesn't seem to respect his seniors... Of course, I'm not referring to myself specifically." (on Kaveh)</p>
  <p>
  The architect of Kshahrewar. This title may sound very impressive, but it's really because the Kshahrewar have a culture of using official titles to inflate one's ego.
  </p>
  <p>The role of architect may seem prestigious, but the truth is, the architect does not have to be present at all major meetings, nor does he participate in core decision-making. The architect is simply responsible for classifying and archiving important documents, and his presence is not required at all times. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Kaveh does not attend any non-essential meeting, and when he does, he only records key points, jotting down other minute details based on his mood. People don't often pay attention to him given his inferior background and credentials.
  </p>
  <p>
  An unqualified person who attended a third-tier university and who keeps a low profile for too long is often perceived as someone with a mysterious identity and ulterior purposes. Kaveh himself fits this description perfectly: he is a corrupt man, but he is only a fake pretender who cannot hold a candle to Howard Roark and only gets funding because of bribery and favoritism as Kaveh shares the same name with someone's relative, leading a carefree and comfortable life.

  <h2>Abilities</h2>
  <p>E causes all dendro cores in aoe to burst.
    E has a 6s cd.
    Recall bloom has damage sequence limit of 2 instances of damage per enemy every 0.5s.
  </p><p>
    Q gives dendro infusion and buffs bloom damage.
    At lv13, Q buffs bloom by 58%, which is quite less than what Nilou's Aeon passive can do. 
    Q is expensive, costing 80 energy.
  </p><p>
    One passve heals Kaveh by 300% of EM when he takes damage from cores.
    Another passive gives him stacks when he does NA/CA/PA in Q mode,
    up to 4 stacks, each stack giving 25 EM.
