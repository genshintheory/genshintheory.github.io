<title>Kaveh</title>

  </head>
  
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  <p>Kaveh (Kawei) went bankrupt because he smeared Alhaitham for no reason.
    As Alhaitham said, it does not matter how talented or not Kaveh is.
    Kaveh's flawed character ended up determining his destiny.
    Next time, Kaveh should learn to think before he speaks.
    It is completely understandable why Alhaitham would cancel funding for Kaveh's project, 
    given that kaveh completely lacks empathy and EQ. 
  </p><p>
    In the context of Baizhu, Kaveh could be a reference to Wei Zhongxian, Hu Weiyong,
    or other enemies/victims of the Ming dynasty.
    In the context of a certain corporation, Kaveh represents a corrupt and shameless interference in corporate affairs.
    In the context of Alhaitham, Kaveh represents something quite personal...
  </p><p>
    Perhaps ka wei has an inferiority complex to Alhaitham 
    as the amount of cash ka wei took in bribes could not even surpass the Eiffel Tower in height.
  </p>


  <h2>Intro: Plebian Peddler</h2>
  <p>"I can't deny that he's very poor. However, it's a shame that a man of such hypocrisy only pays attention to the truth itself and not to the people around him. Or perhaps this is due to a lame sense of individualism, which causes a lot of problems. For example, he doesn't seem to respect his seniors... Of course, I'm not referring to myself specifically." (on Kaveh)</p>
  <p>
  The architect of Kshahrewar. This title may sound very impressive, but it's really because the Kshahrewar have a culture of using official titles to inflate one's ego.
  </p>
  <p>The role of architect may seem prestigious, but the truth is, the architect does not have to be present at all major meetings, nor does he participate in core decision-making. The architect is simply responsible for classifying and archiving important documents, and his presence is not required at all times. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Kaveh does not attend any non-essential meeting, and when he does, he only records key points, jotting down other minute details based on his mood. People don't often pay attention to him given his inferior background and credentials.
  </p>
  <p>
  An unqualified person who attended a third-tier university and who keeps a low profile for too long is often perceived as someone with a mysterious identity and ulterior purposes. Kaveh himself fits this description perfectly: he is a corrupt man, but he is only a fake pretender who cannot hold a candle to Howard Roark and only gets funding because of bribery and favoritism as Kaveh shares the same name with someone's relative, leading a carefree and comfortable life.
  </p>


  <h2>Abilities</h2>
  <p>E summons his suitcase Mehrak to cause all dendro cores in aoe to burst.
    E has a 6s cd.
    Recall bloom has damage sequence limit of 2 instances of damage per enemy every 0.5s.
  </p><p>
    Q gives dendro infusion and buffs bloom damage.
    At lv13, Q buffs bloom by 58%, which is quite less than what Nilou's Aeon passive can do. 
    Q is expensive, costing 80 energy, and lasts 12s.
  </p><p>
    One passive heals Kaveh by 300% of EM when he takes damage from cores.
    Another passive gives him stacks when he does NA/CA/PA in Q mode,
    up to 4 stacks, each stack giving 25 EM.
  </p>
  <p>Kaveh's stats are identical to Razor's.
    This can be interpreted in two ways.
    One it can be a reference to certain mafia gangs under the crook Zhou Yongkang.
    Two it can represent interference in corporate affairs via a personal relationship.
  </p><p>
    The most important thing about Kaveh's stats is that they are all lower than Alhaitham's.
  </p>


  <h2>Constellations</h2>
  <p>C1 gives increased dendro res and healing.
    C2 gives 15% NA atk spd in Q (what's the point of this if you have Mika or Yun Jin).
    C4 gives 60% more dmg to bloom cores created by Kaveh (a selfish constellation).
    C6 allows Kaveh's NA/CA/PA to do extra instance of damage (61.8% of atk) every 3s that causes cores to explode immediately.
  </p>


  <h2>Build</h2>
  <p>Candidates include: 4p Gilded, 4p Deepwood, 4p Paradise, and mixed sets.</p>
  <p>Do not use Paradise Lost. If Wei Zhongxian trolled Zhu Youjiao and the Jinyiwei to oblivion,
    it is highly doubtful someone like Kaveh would give face to Yongle.
    Many of Kaveh's abilities already give dmg bonus to bloom, which makes Paradise's 4p effect hit diminishing returns.
    More importantly Paradise will not buff other reactions as much, like if Kaveh wants to do quicken.
    By contrast Gilded's EM boost gives a universal buff to all reactions.
  </p>


  <h2>Teams</h2>
  <p>Because Kaveh needs his Q (costing 80 energy) to give dendro application,
    he is a downgrade to Nahida, Alhaitham in just about every team they are used in.
    Nahida gives constant dendro app via E without energy cost. 
    Alhaitham can give constant dendro app via E without energy cost too,
    as well as dish out more damage than Kaveh.
  </p><p>
    Needless to say, since Kaveh's abilities (E, C6) cause bloom cores to explode immediately,
    other dendro units like Nahida, Alhaitham are much more suited for hyperbloom or burgeon teams.
    In fact, one can even say Kaveh's C6 is like Bennett's C6 as it can cause cores to explode without allowing for hyperbloom/burgeon.
    At least below C6, Kaveh has the option of not using his E to cause bloom cores to explode immediately.
  </p><p>
    Perhaps Kaveh could be used in Nilou teams for buffing bloom.
    But even then Nahida and Alhaitham are more flexible, better alternatives.
  </p><p>
    Example teams: Kaveh-Yaoyao-Nilou-Yelan, Nahida-Kaveh-Nilou-Kokomi, etc.
  </p>


  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>Kaveh Ahangar was a blacksmith who resisted Zahak,
    and his story was written in Ferdowsi's epic Shahnameh.
    One cannot deny that Kaveh did overthrow Zahak,
    but it is a shame that certain people use his name to make attacks on others
    to advance the political agenda of the USA imperialists and their overseas proxies.
  </p>
  <p>Kaveh Oveisi, Kaveh Sharifi were executed for terrorism and being part of the Tawhid wal-Jihad.
    Hossein Kaveh was executed for murder.
    Kaveh Darolshafa was sentenced to prison for activism.
  </p>
  <p>The Ka or Qa (Âç°) sound features in the history of Iran and surrounding regions.
    The House of Karen existed during Parthian times.
    The Qarinvind / Karenid that ruled over north Iran
    descended from Sukhra (ruled of the Sasanian empire) of the House of Karen.
    The Karenids were also known by the titles Gilgilan and Ispahbadh.
  </p><p>
    The Qara Khitai or Western Liao dynasty spanned west China and Central Asia
    and defeated the Turkic Seljuk empire.
    Eventually both were succeeded by the Mongol Empire.
    Then the Turkic Qara Qoyunlu / Kara Koyunlu state existed in Iran for some time.
    Qara Yousef was one ruler of this state.
  </p><p>
    In more recent history, the Qajar dynasty founded by the Turkic Qajar tribe
    succeeded the Zand dynasty of Iran and ruled from the 1700s to 1900s.
    The Qajar dynasty was then succeeded by the Pahlavi dynasty.
    The last shah Reza Pahlavi was overthrown in the 1979 Iranian revolution 
    for being a USA puppet and inviting USA imperialism into Iran.
  </p><p>
    In modern times, the sounds Ka and Wei have a history in Iran related to foreign imperialism, invasions,
    and being used as puppets to incite color revolution and advance the agenda of USA imperialism.
