  <p>Kaveh (Kawei) went bankrupt because he smeared Alhaitham for no reason.
    As Alhaitham said, it does not matter how talented or not Kaveh is.
    Kaveh's flawed character ended up determining his destiny.
    Next time, Kaveh should learn to think before he speaks.
    If I were Alhaitham, I would also cancel funding for Kaveh's project.
