  <h2>Art</h2>
  <p>The 4.0 sp stated that the Genshin art team based Fontaine's geography on Europe
    and they tried to distinguish Fontaine from Mondstadt, given the two are close to each other.
    They mentioned they were inspired by baroque era and art deco designs.
    In particular, they based some of the designs off of the Alps.
  </p><p>
    Fontaine is surrounded by waterfalls.
    One of the designers mentioned that rendering water is a challenge in the industry.
  </p>


  <h2>Diving</h2>
  <p>The diving and underwater swimming is done right in Genshin.
    In too many other games, swimming underwater is a slow and tedious process.
    But Genshin actually makes diving quite fast, even faster than swimming above water.
    So the diving experience is pretty smooth so far.
    And it is convenient that one can switch characters/team underwater too.
    Apparently, there is no need to breath as there is no oxygen meter as per the livestream.
  </p>
  <p>Will we be able to dive underwater in other areas of the map?
    Like in the waters around the Alcor, Liyue, or Inazuma?
  </p><p>
    If there was one thing some Bioshock fans wanted in Rapture:
    it was the ability to swim and dive underwater.
    Genshin did a good job bringing this mechanic to the game.
  </p>

  <p>The Chiming domain gives buffs based on hp changes: nice domain for Xiao.
    Fontaine is starting to look like Xiao land with all the hp gimmicks.

  <h2>Banners</h2>
  <p>The weapon banner...</p>
