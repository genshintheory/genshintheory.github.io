  <h2>Art</h2>
  <p>The 4.0 sp stated that the Genshin art team based Fontaine's geography on Europe
    and they tried to distinguish Fontaine from Mondstadt, given the two are close to each other.
    They mentioned they were inspired by baroque era and art deco designs.
    In particular, they based some of the designs off of the Alps.
  </p><p>
    Fontaine is surrounded by waterfalls.
    One of the designers mentioned that rendering water is a challenge in the industry.
  </p>


  <h2>Diving</h2>
  <p>The diving and underwater swimming is done right in Genshin.
    In too many other games, swimming underwater is a slow and tedious process.
    But Genshin actually makes diving quite fast, even faster than swimming above water.
    So the diving experience is pretty smooth so far.
    And it is convenient that one can switch characters/team underwater too.
    Apparently, there is no need to breath as there is no oxygen meter as per the livestream.
  </p>
  <p>Will we be able to dive underwater in other areas of the map?
    Like in the waters around the Alcor, Liyue, or Inazuma?
  </p><p>
    If there was one thing some Bioshock fans wanted in Rapture:
    it was the ability to swim and dive underwater.
    Genshin did a good job bringing this mechanic to the game.
  </p>

  <h2>The path of destruction</h2>
  <p>The Chiming domain (Pale Forgotten) gives buffs based on hp changes: nice domain for Xiao.
    Fontaine is starting to look like Xiao land with all the hp gimmicks: the land of destruction.
    Perhaps Xiao got his 'western education' in Fontaine, learning the art of the destruction dao.
  </p>

  <h2>QoL updates</h2>
  <p>The menu now added new styles to the background when selecting teams.
    This is fine and spiffy.
    If it were possible to switch teams as quickly as in star rail, that would be nice too.
  </p><p>
    The map also displays different levels of depth.
    Besides Fontaine with its underwater regions, 
    this makes exploration convenient in some former regions such as Sumeru (the deserts and jungle).
  </p>

  <h2>Banners</h2>
  <p>The weapon banner...</p>

  <h2>Fountain of Lucine</h2>
  <p>Big improvement from Sumeru: one does not need to go through a long quest to access the hydro sigil reward system.</p>

  <h2>Mona land</h2>
  <p>Mona writes for the Steambird in Fontaine.
    As a hydro catalyst she also happens to be convenient for harvesting those romaritime flowers.
    Barbara works too.
  </p>

  <h2>Fleuve Cendre Ferryman</h2>
  <p>This sword can be obtained by fishing.</p>


  <h2>Archon quest</h2>
  <p>The scene with Marcel getting drowned at the end is reminiscent of how Booker DeWitt (Comstock) 
    is drowned by all the copies of Elizabeth in Bioshock Infinite.
    Booker (Comstock) turns out to be the father of Elizabeth in a parallel multiverse.
    A morbid scene, but it was quite the surprise that Genshin imitated that part of Bioshock as well,
    with all the other jubilant fanfare about the Steambird, Victorian era steampunk, 
    cities underwater like Rapture, flying high in the sky lke Columbia.
