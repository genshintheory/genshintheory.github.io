<p><b>Shenhe</b> (申鹤) is a Cryo support character.
</p>

<h2>Talents</h2>

<h3>Elemental Skill</h3>
<p>This is the core of her support abilities.
  Using her E will buff Cryo attacks by giving bonus damage that scales with her total ATK.
  This bonus damage is added after multiplying ATK and scaling but is multiplied by DMG Bonus, CRIT, RES, DEF modifiers, etc.
  $$(ATK*scaling + bonus)*(1+\text{DMG Bonus %})*CRIT$$
  The bonus part above scales with Shenhe's ATK (82.18% ATK at Lv10) and applies to Cryo attacks.
  Yun Jin has a similar buff except the bonus scales with DEF and applies to normal attacks.
  
  The effect of the above on damage is
  $$1 + \frac{bonus}{ATK*scaling} = 1 + \frac{.8218(\text{Shenhe ATK})}{\text{Character ATK}*scaling} \approx 1 + \frac{1}{scaling}$$
  Since Shenhe will usually be built with high ATK, the above simplification assumes that around 
  80% of Shenhe's ATK will be equal to the ATK of whatever dps carry she is supporting.
  This is a very rough estimate and may be more or less in practice.
  But the general result is that the lower the scaling on the Cryo attack, the bigger the buff,
  and conversely the higher the scaling (like for one big nuke) the lower the buff.
  The scaling can be 100-200% for Cryo attacks broken into smaller parts
  such as normal attacks from Ayaka's infused CA
  or the ice blade hits from Chongyun's burst.
  In this case, Shenhe's buff can almost double the damage of the attack (if the scaling is 100% then the buff is 2 times).
  This kind of buff is more broken than Bennett's buff (which can increase damage around 1.5 times).
  To balance this, Shenhe's buff has a quota of 5/7 Cryo hits and only applies to Cryo.
  So it limits the amount of times the buff applies and for what type of moves, or else Shenhe would just be infinitely broken.
</p><p>
  With one of her passives, her E can also buff the damage of normal/charged/plunging attacks, skills, and bursts by 15% 
  depending on whether it is pressed or held.
</p>

<h3>Elemental Skill</h3>
<p>
  Her Q will lower the Cryo/Physical RES of the enemy by 15%, but this is less than Anemo VV, Superconduct, Zhongli shield, and Eula E.
  With her passive, it will also increase Cryo DMG by 15%.
  With her C2, it increases the CRIT DMG of Cryo by 15% (a similar effect to C6 Sara, C6 Gorou, or C6 Itto).
</p>

<h2>Constellations</h2>
<p>C1 gives an extra charge to E.
  C2 gives CRIT DMG to Cryo.
  C3 gives +3 E.
  C4 gives extra damage to Shenhe's E cast.
  C5 gives +3 Q.
  C6 removes the trigger quota for NA/CA.
</p>
<p>
  Her C6 is pretty broken for Ayaka, but not really needed for Ganyu.
  The reason is Ganyu's CA is split into a few large chunks, whereas Ayaka's CA is split into several smaller chunks.
  So Shenhe buffs Ayaka a lot more than Ganyu.
  Second reason is that Ganyu attacks slow enough that a 5/7 quota is enough to last for the cd of Shenhe's E,
  especially if Shenhe gets 2 charges at C1.
  </p>

<h2>Build</h2>
<p>2 piece Glad, 2 piece Shimenawa OR 4 piece Blizzard Strayer.
</p><p>
  ATK/ER sands, ATK/Cryo DMG goblet, ATK/CRIT circlet.
  Substats: ATK, CRIT > ER.
</p><p>
  5 stars: Calamity Queller, Skyward Spine, PJWS, Homa. 
  4 stars: Deathmatch, Blackcliff, Catch, Crescent Pike, Starglitter, Lithic.
</p>

<h2>Teams</h2>
<p>
  She can support Chongyun, Ayaka, Eula, Ganyu teams.
  She is best used as a support for Chongyun and Ayaka specifically.
  As explained above, she does not buff Ganyu as much as Ayaka.
  Also Eula cannot really use the Cryo damage bonus she provides since most of Eula's damage is physical.
  Eula can only really benefit from the RES shred on Shenhe's Q and the burst/normal attack bonus from her E passive.
  Shenhe can also work with Kaeya, Rosaria, Aloy and even other Cryo characters like Qiqi.
</p>
<p>
  She can be used on Physical, Freeze, reverse melt teams.
  Examples include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Shenhe Chongyun Xingqiu Kazuha</li>
<li>Shenhe Mona Ayaka Kazuha</li>
<li>Shenhe Ayaka Kokomi Venti</li>
</ul>
