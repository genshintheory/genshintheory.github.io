  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>Talent priority: E.
    Leveling Q is not as necessary unless you care about damage.
    The E gives a DEF buff and has 100% uptime (10s cd, 10s duration).
    His Q costs 80 energy, so running an ER sands or weapon can be common.
  </p><p>
    One passive buffs the team def by 25% for 12s after he uses his Q.
    Another passive buffs his own E and Q damage based on his DEF.
    His Q damage scales with his DEF like Albedo's E.
  </p><p>
    His C4 allows his Q to heal based on his DEF.
    His C6 allows his E and Q to buff geo crit dmg by 40%.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For artifacts, one can use 4p husk (for Q damage and C4 healing), 
    2p emblem for ER, and hybrid builds.
    Substats are ER, DEF, crit.
