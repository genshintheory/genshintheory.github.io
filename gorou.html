  <p>Heralded as Geo Bennett, Miss Hina is a geo bow user whose niche is buffing def and geo damage.</p>

  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>Talent priority: E.
    Leveling Q is not as necessary unless you care about damage.
    The E gives a DEF buff and has 100% uptime (10s cd, 10s duration).
    His Q costs 80 energy, so running an ER sands or weapon can be common.
  </p><p>
    One passive buffs the team def by 25% for 12s after he uses his Q.
    Another passive buffs his own E and Q damage based on his DEF.
    His Q damage scales with his DEF like Albedo's E.
  </p><p>
    His C4 allows his Q to heal based on his DEF.
    His C6 allows his E and Q to buff geo crit dmg by 40%.
  </p>

  <p>Fun fact: after using his NA Ripping Fang Fletching,
    he will growl.
  </p>

  
  <h2>Build</h2>
  <p>
    For artifacts, one can use 4p husk (for Q damage and C4 healing), 
    2p emblem for ER, and hybrid builds.
    Desired substats are ER, DEF, crit.
  </p><p>
    Best weapons include Elegy (for ER) and Favonius.
  </p>


  <h2>Comments</h2>
  <p>Man, there's something interesting about the sounds Go, Gor in his name,
    especially since he is geo and works with Morax on Itto teams.
    It reminds one of Al Gore and some other real life people.
