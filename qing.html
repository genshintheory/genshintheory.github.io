  <h2>Calculations</h2>
  <p>Level 10 q has total scaling
    $$s_q = 158.4 + 8(43.2) + 339.84 = 843.84$$
    It costs 40 energy and has 12s cd.
    Assuming 61.6 electro dmg bonus for Qing (e.g. 2tf) the dps is
    $$x_q = 1.616s_q/12 = 113.63712$$
  </p><p>
    Level 10 e has total scaling
    $$s_e = 90.72 + 302.4 = 393.12$$
    This is for doing double e to get infusion.
    (If one does e then ca detonation scaling is \(90.72 + 2(151.2)\)).
    Note c1 adds extra instance of damage to double e,
    but we are considering c0 here.
  </p><p>
    The e has a 7.5s cd. The dps is
    $$x_e = 1.616s_e/7.5 = 84.704256$$
    She gains an electro infusion from this ability
    and can also plunge attack with it.
  </p><p>
    Total dps from e and q only is
    $$x_e + x_q = 198.341376$$
  </p><p>
    Usually, one spams electro-infused CA when using Qing as a dps.
    At level 10, CA has scaling \(151.81+170 = 321.81\)
    and N1 has scaling 81.09.
    Qing can do 4 N1C1 within her infusion duration (before refreshing with E again).
    The dps is:
