<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Support_Tierlist">Support Tierlist</span></h2>
<p>Here, utility supports are units with off-field abilities that can benefit the team.
  For the longest time, Venti or Bennett were undisputably considered the top supports of the game.
  But since 3.2, Nahida can be said to have claimed the throne as best support in the game.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Nahida: Nahida long-lasting 100% uptime off-field aoe dendro application often makes her the best dendro support for quicken and bloom teams.
    Because of hyperbloom's insanely high dps, Nahida's value is god-level as the premium dendro sub-dps.
    Hyperbloom has almost eliminated the need to have Bennett on every team.
    And because hyperbloom can autotarget on enemies, it almost eliminates a need to have tons of crowd control.
    Nahida also gives an EM buff with her burst and can do high sub-dps with her E.
    All other dendro supports either lack 100% uptime on dendro app, have large burst costs on app, lack aoe, have icd issues, 
    or do not last as long as Nahida's E.
    If you have Nahida, there is basically no reason to use any other dendro support.
  </li>
  <li>Venti: Should come as no surprise. Venti has been broken since the game's start. He may not work in every situation, but when he does work, he is a literal game-changer. Also, even with a Level 1 weapon and no artifacts, Venti will still do his job. This cannot be said about any other support. There is no way to powercreep the AoE CC Venti provides without releasing a Venti 2.0, making him one of the most future-proof supports in game. Venti's burst can destroy mobs so quickly that it basically makes Venti a DPS character, and Venti does not even have to be on field.</li>
  <li>Bennett: Broken ATK buff, heals, can even solo an Electro Abyss Lector's shield. But does not work for every character like Hu Tao or every team (Morgana or other Freeze Team). Bennett C6 can also mess up some characters (like Eula). Hard to powercreep without releasing a 5 star version with better scaling (a Bennett 2.0 if you will).
    Introduction of more hp scaling units as well as dendro/hyperbloom teams has chipped away at Bennett's universality as a support,
    but bouken da bouken is still broken.
  </li>
  <li>Raiden: provides good energy generation (though Venti can also refund energy too) and buffs bursts. Raiden's burst also can deal a lot of damage (more so at C2) that is also AoE. Raiden is optimal on a Eula team. Other than that, the utility she provides is not as broken or needed as some of the other characters on the list. Raiden E with full EM can also be used to drive hyperbloom.</li>
  <li>Mona: has great AoE and an excellent burst that also provides a universal damage bonus. She has one of the strongest nukes in the game and provides cc immobilization and a taunt. Good for freeze teams. If Mona were Cryo, that would not necessarily be better as Mona's burst can do 2x vaporize damage (whereas a Cryo nuke only does 1.5x melt damage), and one still needs Hydro for Freeze teams. One can make a similar argument for why a "Cryo Childe" would not necessarily powercreep Childe.</li>
  <li>Faruzan: best anemo buffer in the game and a role model for what an elemental buffer should do.</li>
  <li>Yelan: better than Xingqiu and can even provide dmg bonus of up to 50%.</li>
  <li>Sucrose: like Venti can use the VV set to shred RES and provide good AoE CC. A C6 Sucrose is better than C0 Kazuha because Sucrose can use Thrilling Tales. Sucrose can also give dmg bonus and EM. It is just that Sucrose set the bar very high and is vastly underrated as a support.</li>
  <li>Jean: Jean can also provide fall damage with her skill, and her burst can apply Anemo giving it interesting applications in removing debuffs and swirling Pyro with Bennett's burst. C4 also shreds 40% anemo res.</li>
  <li>Kuki Shinobu: full EM build great for hyperblom and healing.</li>
  <li>Yaoyao: off-field dendro app via E, healer, can be used as Nahida-substitute in bloom teams.</li>
  <li>Mika: atk spd buff via E, physical damage buffer, healer</li>
  <li>Xingqiu is only useful for pyro dps (or double hydro). In almost every other situation, he is not needed or can be replaced by another hydro character. Xingqiu is overrated and very single-target, whereas most other units above have much better AoE. Moreover, it is very easy to powercreep Xingqiu just by releasing a Cryo version of Xingqiu (to make the Pyro carries deal 2x damage instead of 1.5x).</li>
  <li>Morax: Can shred RES and provide shield. C6 can even heal (which messes up characters like Hu Tao). But in end, really only provides defensive buff, whereas many other teams (hyperbloom, Rational, Morgana, Hu Tao-Thoma, Childe-Xiangling) need more offense and do not need Zhongli. At C0, in terms of RES shred, Zhongli is powercrept by Viridescent Venerer or Superconduct for most elements except Anemo RES. Zhongli is best suited as a Xiao support. With the release of Deepwood, Zhongli fell even further out of the meta.</li>
  <li>Kazuha: worse than Sucrose as a support. Kazuha is almost better suited as a sub-dps or damage-dealer.
  At C6, Kazuha becomes more like a dps (Xiao) and less like a support (Sucrose/Venti).</li>
  <li>Kokomi: E has no icd on hydro app, good for bloom teams</li>
  <li>Nilou: can provide singificant buff to bloom damage, but restricted to dendro-hydro teams</li>
  <li>Thoma: can shield for hu tao teams and drive burgeon teams</li>
  <li>Gorou: almost irreplaceable as an Itto/Noelle support for buffing DEF and geo damage</li>
  <li>Honorable Mention: Barbara with Thrilling Tales, great healing, great for bloom teams</li>
</ol>

<p>Most teams that clear abyss will use at least one of the supports above.</p>


<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Childe is more an on-field "support" (or "enabler") whereas these other characters are more off-field supports.
    Question becomes: why not use hydro catalyst as enabler? That is because catalysts will have ICD on their NA/CA.
    On the other hand, Childe with riptide can apply hydro much faster. Yelan/XQ can also apply hydro faster via their bursts.
  </li>
  <li>Alhaitham is similar to Childe in that he can also be used as a dendro driver for creating a lot of bloom cores or proccing quicken/spread a lot.
    Same question: why not use dendro catalyst as driver? Same answer: because dendro catalysts will have ICD (do not apply dendro as fast).
    Alhaitham's mirrors actually have a unique ICD (2 hit rule) and when combined with his dendro infusion,
    Alhaitham actually applies dendro very fast.
  </li>
  <li>Xiangling is more like a dps than a support: her burst applies aoe pyro without icd, 
    but there are few hydro/cryo dps that can use that to vape/melt their hits.
    Ganyu is probably one of the only cryo units that can use XL as a support for melt,
    but even then Dehya is a better alternative as Dehya's E does not cost 80 energy.
  </li>
  <li>As for which characters are most important: in the game you need both DPS and support characters. They are equally as important (and it can be argued that one needs a DPS character to clear all the content in the game). Supports come and go and can be replaced. It is subjective to say support characters are more important (those who say this are more biased towards support characters). Being able to use a character in every situation does not necessarily make them better. They may then be a jack of all trades and master of none.</li>
  <li>Healers and Shielders are equally as important. In fact, it can be argued that healing is more necessary (especially with Corrosion). Those who say Shields are more important are biased towards Zhongli (or worse Baizhu). They are also the same people who think supports are more important and use math to mislead and fool the people.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Characters that do their job without really needing artifacts or weapons are:
  Chongyun (E infusion), Childe (fast hydro application through E), Alhaitham (fast dendro app via E), Venti (cc), 
  Kokomi (off-field E), Dehya (off-field E), Nahida (off-field E).
  Note hyperbloom teams do need artifacts and weapons to perform well (full EM builds).
  Bennett needs a max-level sword to maximize his atk buff.
  Morax needs hp on artifacts at least to make sure his shield is not paper thin.
  Raiden either wants 4p Emblem crit build or full EM build to function well.
  Any character that needs their burst to provide support needs at least some ER on their artifacts.
</p>


<h2>Top buffers</h2>
<p>
  These are supports/buffs that increase the damage of others.
  The following factors are considered: how big the buff is, how widely applicable it is, 
  how easily achievable it is, how long it lasts (if there is any downtime).
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Faruzan (C6): 1.5-2 times damage for anemo dps only. 
    Anemo res shred, dmg bonus, additive dmg, crit dmg bonus makes her a model buffer.
    She buffs anemo in nearly every possible way.
    What distinguishes her from other buffers is that her buff lasts 18s (at C2)
    and she provides crowd control.
    Faruzan is a role model buffer.
    <!-- do calc -->
  </li>
  <li>Tie:
    <ul>
    <li>Yun Jin (C0): 1.5-2 times damage for NA only</li>
    <li>Shenhe: 1.5-2 times damage for Cryo only, has quota of 5/7, unless have C6. Also shreds cryo, physical RES with Q.</li>
    <li>Bennett (C5): 1.5 times damage for ATK-scaling skills (most characters and skills), heals</li>
  </ul>
</li>
  <li>Mona (C0): Q gives 60% dmg bonus (for all elements). If one has no other sources of dmg bonus that is 1.6 times more damage. 
    Say one uses a goblet of 46.6% dmg bonus. Then Mona's buff gives around a 1.41 times increase in damage.
    C1 can buff hydro reaction damage.
  </li>
  <li>Nahida: when run with deepwood, 
    also gives EM buff on Q (some characters like Cyno, Alhaitham benefit more from this than others), 
    C2 also shreds 30% def on quickened enemies \( 1/(1-.3/2)\approx 1.18 \), 
    while buffing reaction damage (on average 1.2 times).
    Combining deepwood with C2 effect can give around a 1.4 times buff to dendro damage.
    C2 alone gives around a 1.2 times buff to reaction damage.
    If she has 1k EM, her Q gives 250 EM, which can give at most a 2.78 times buff to transformative reaction damage (16*250/2250=1.78)
    1.42 times buff to amplifying reaction damage (2.78*250/1650),
    and 1.86 times more additive damage (5*250/1450) compared to a 0 EM character.
  </li>
  <li>Kujou Sara: lv13 E gives 91% of base atk as bonus atk to character, buff lasts 6s and is not confined to space. 
    By contrast, lv13 Bennett Q gives 119% of base atk as bonus atk, buff lasts 12s and heals (and is localized to a region of space).
    So if Bennett can give 1k atk, Sara may be able to give 700-800.
    For a character with 2k atk initially, Sara can buff atk by around 1.4 times.
    With C6, she can buff electro crit dmg by 60%.
    For characters with 200% crit dmg, this is an increase of 1.2 times in damage.
    Combining both c6 crit dmg buff with atk buff can give around 1.7 times more damage for electro dps.
  </li>
  <li>Gorou: Q gives 25% def (for 12s), lv13 E gives 438 flat def and 15% geo dmg bonus (100% uptime), 
    C6 gives 40% geo crit dmg (for 12s).
    Crit dmg buff can give 3.4/3=1.3 times more damage.
    The 15% geo dmg bonus is not much.
    <!-- If character (Itto, Noelle) has def sands 58.3% with husk set 54% (for 112.3% def),  -->
    Say character has base def of around 800-900.
    Gorou's def buffs can give around 600 more def.
    If character converts def to atk at near 1:1 ratio and can reach 4k atk this way,
    then Gorou's def buff is about 1.15 times more damage.
    Combining both the C6 crit dmg buff with the def buff can give around 1.5 times more damage for def-scaling geo dps.
  </li>
  <li>Mika: gives 30% physical dmg bonus, atk spd, C6 gives 60% physical crit dmg buff.
    How atk spd bonus translates into dmg increase depends on character.
    As estimate, if lv13 E gives 25% atk spd, suppose it is 1.25 times more damage.
    Combined with crit dmg buff (1.2 times, cf Sara) that is around 1.5 times more damage.
  </li>
  <li>Venti C6 gives -60% res shred (for autumn element) when combined with vv. 
    C6 gives -20% to absorbed element, while vv gives -40% res shred.
    That is 1.389 times more damage against the swirled element.
  </li>
  <li>Sucrose, Kazuha: can use vv as well as give dmg bonus and CC. 
    Kazuha can give 40% dmg bonus (to autumn elements), but that's less than Mona.
    Sucrose can also give EM.
  </li>
  <li>Viridescent Venerer, Superconduct: around 1.28 times damage (-40% RES). 
    Other effects that give up to 40% res shred include Jean C4.</li>
    <li>Nilou C2 gives -35% res shred to hydro and dendro</li>
    <li>Venti C6 gives -32% anemo res shred (C2 makes E give -12% anemo res for 10s), while C6 makes Q give further -20% anemo res</li>
  <li>Deepwood: around 1.22 times damage, -30% dendro res in between VV and Morax</li>
  <li>Eula: E gives 25% res shred to cryo and physical for 7s (with 4s press cd), which is actually nuts coming from a dps hypercarry</li>
  <li>Zhongli/Geo resonance: around 1.17 times damage (-20% RES); even though it has 100% uptime and applies to everything, it is also the lowest numerical buff on the list; this is the game's way of balancing things, but then one remembers that the game did not exactly balance broken da broken Bennett</li>
  <li>Beidou C6, Rosaria C6, Xiangling C1, etc.: shred RES by 15%</li>
  <li>Yelan: Q gives 1-50% dmg bonus, increasing over time, on average around a 25% dmg bonus buff, which is less than Kazuha.</li>
  </ol>


  <h2>Enablers/drivers</h2>
  <p>Here we separate reaction enablers from other buffers.
    Technically enablers can act as buffers 
    by buffing other people's damage by applying an element to enable certain reactions like vaporize.
    But this is less about giving a buff to another character than it is about elemental application on an enemy
    (unless one wants to think of res/def shred as applying a special type of element/reaction on an enemy).
  </p><p>
    Not every character will be considered a driver/enabler if their ICD limits them from applying their element fast enough.
    Here we consider certain special characters that bypass ICD limitations.
  </p>
  <!-- anemo driver for hyperbloom, taser -->
  <ol>
    <li>Dehya: 1.5 times reaction damage (for melt), no energy cost</li>
    <li>Alhaitham: hyperbloom/quicken driver, unique ICD 2-hit rule</li>
    <li>Nahida: hyperbloom/quicken driver, no ICD on E app</li>
    <li>Raiden/Yae/Kuki: hyperbloom drivers</li>
  <li>Childe: 1.5 times reaction damage (for vaporize), no energy cost</li>
  <li>Yelan: 1.5 times reaction damage (for vape), energy cost 70</li>
  <li>Xingqiu, Xiangling: 1.5 times reaction damage (for vaporize/melt), high energy cost of 80</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Chongyun can enable Xiangling to melt several of her Pyronado hits.
    However, there is currently no Cryo support that can enable ON-field Pyro carries to melt on every hit efficiently
    (there is no Cryo Xingqiu/Childe).
    There is Xiangling as an off-field Pyro applicator (with no ICD on Pyronado), 
    but there is no Hydro DPS that can vaporize every hit
    (unless you play as charged attack Mona, Childe, etc. on Xiangling's Pyronado
    but that's not really the focus of their kit).
    Otherwise we would have a buffer that can enable 2 times melt/vaporize damage.
    Such a character would be at Yun Jin-Shenhe level on this list
    since although the buff is big, it would only apply to certain Pyro or Hydro characters.
  </p>
  <p>Currently one can try Candace Q for hydro infusion with XL to simulate a hydro vape dps.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note most of the above buffs do not apply to transformative reactions
    (which are buffed by certain artifacts effects, EM, Nahida C2, etc.).
