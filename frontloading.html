  <h2>What if Noctis were redesigned?</h2>
  <p>Noctis is different from Xiaogan in that Xiaogan can frontload her damage more.
    She can also store stacks, and more stacks beyond 3 will boost her damage.
    However Noctis can only consume 3 droplets at a time for his CA.
    It is not like he can consume 4, 5, 6, or more to buff his CA (and thus frontload his damage more).
  </p><p>
    Similarly Alhaitham can frontload his damage by getting 3 mirrors instantly.
    The more mirrors he has the more damage he does.
    In HSR, Lunae is a character that can frontload damage by consuming up to 3 sp.
  </p><p>
    So for Noctis do be more like Xiaogan or Alhaitham,
    he would need some mechanism to consume more than 3 droplets/stacks.
    For example, perhaps consuming 4/5/6 droplets will increase the scaling on his CA as well as its dmg bonus/crit/aoe.
    This way his CA can have different 'levels' similar to Xiaogan or Alhaitham.
    Absorbing 3 droplets gives a lv0 CA, 4 droplets lv1, 5 droplets lv2, 6 droplets lv3.
  </p><p>
    Technical note: as for the numbers, it could also be absorbing 3/6/9 droplets.
    His E creates 3, his Q creates 6.
  </p><p>
    This can then make supports that give droplets (like HMC) potentially more useful.
    Droplets can then almost act like skill points in Genshin.
  </p><p>
    And a support like Sparkle from HSR could be easier to create:
    Sparkle can generate more droplets (sp) for Noctis.
    For example, her ultimate can create say 4 droplets (or even 12).
    And she can increase the number of droplets/sp that exist on field from 15 to say 21.
    Here we are using the conversion that 1 sp = 3 droplets.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, the question becomes can Noctis choose how many droplets/sp to consume?
    Currently, in Genshin he would just automatically absorb all droplets nearby.
    It is not like he can only absorb 1 or 2 droplets when a 3rd exists.
  </p>


  <h2>Alhaitham's frontloading</h2>
  <p>As discussed, sp in HSR operate similarly to cooldowns in Genshin.
    So Alhaitham's C1 of reducing cd essentially allows him to frontload his damage more often 
    (have higher uptime on 2-3 mirrors).
    It is almost analogous to if Lunae had more sp to spend each turn.
  </p><p>
    One main difference between Alhaitham and Lunae is that Alhaitham has hyperbloom.
    Otherwise, if playing Alhaitham in a pure quicken team,
    his ability to frontload his personal damage (that can crit) is actually similar to Lunae.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alhaitham's C6 encourages frontloading damage even more,
    increasing his crit value when he has more than 3 mirrors.
