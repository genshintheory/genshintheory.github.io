<title>Nilou</title>

  <p>
    Nilou has higher base hp than zhongli and performs at the Zubayr theater.
    Zubayr is the name of an Arabic commander who served Muhammad in the early Arab conquests 
    during the expansion of Islam.
    Zubayr reached as far east as Iraq, and his descendants would become influential in Iraq and Iran.
  </p>

  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>
    Arabs and Persians (Iranians) are two different groups of people.
    For one, they speak two pretty different languages.
    The Arabic language is part of the Afro-Asiatic (Semitic) family,
    whereas Farsi has a more eastern origin and is part of the Indo-Aryan family.
    The grammar and cognate stems of these two language groups are very different.
  </p><p>
    Furthermore, Iran had a long history way before the rise of Islam and the Arabs around the 600s.
    Iran's history dates back to the Persian empire, Alexander's Hellenic empire, the Parthian empire, and the Sassanid empire.
    Iran also dealt with various groups from the steppes and Central Asia such as the Scythians and Hunnites (related to the Huns).
    Moreover, Iran had its own religions such as Manicheaism, Zoroastrianism, even Buddhism, Christianity, Judaism
    before the rise of Islam.
  </p><p>
    Around the rise of Islam, there were the Turks to the north and east and the Arabs to the west.
    These two groups would play a huge role in the history of Persia for the next 1000 years.
    During the Arab conquest of Persia, many Iranians were converted to Islam.
    Iran gradually adapted the Arabic script and imported many Arab loanwords (many of which are related to Islam).
    The Turks would eventually rule over Iran and the Middle East, establishing the Seljuk and Ottoman empires and adopting Islam.
    But the Turks also established other khanates in the western steppe regions:
    some Turks even formed the Khazar Khanate and converted to Judaism (this is where the Khazar Jew term comes from).
  </p><p>
    Arabs and Persians do share some genes, notably hg J.
    In general, Persians tend to have more northern steppe and eastern genes from hg K (including NOQR),
    signifying how Iran is geographically close to China and India.
    By contrast Arabs tend to have more genes commonly found in North Africa, notably hg E.
  </p>

  <p>Nilou's name looks similar to Nile which is written 尼罗 (niluo) in Chinese.
    Coincidentally, Nilou is also hydro.
  </p><p>
    When the translators say that Nilou is 'innocent' like that 3.0 event with Collei,
    this makes people suspicious.
    Nilou may have her own dirty laundry and crimes she committed.
  </p><p>
    In the story, Nilou can be seen talking to Jut.
    But for her ascension, she has to defeat the Blightdrake (zhaozai yongjie) boss.
    There will not be another yongle in history.
    People are not dumb enough to fall for the same trick twice.
    But on the pity topic of Sumeru and bringing in characters like Yelan, Collei, or Layla,
    perhaps Nilou could be a slight allusion to the Yuan dynasty general Ni Wenjun
    who plotted to assassinate Xu Shouhui but failed.
    If this is the case, then perhaps that partially explains why Candace does not work with Nilou.
  </p>

  <p>But going back to the Middle East,
    Nilou could be a veiled reference to Nimr Baqir,
    who was executed and beheaded in 2016 for inciting terrorism in Saudi Arabia.
    This event also had a profound effect in Iran.
    It is perhaps not much a coincidence that Nilou happens to be a Persian name.
  </p><p>
    If there is anything to be said on the current geopolitical situation of this region,
    the USA invaded Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, interfering in numerous proxy wars in the region,
    inciting color revolutions such as the Arab Spring, overthrowing governments,
    causing chaos and instability for the sake of asserting its petrodollar hegemony.
    The real enemy here is the USA hegemon.
  </p><p>
    The Iranian revolution of 1979 overthrew the USA puppet Pahlavi and purged USA interference in Iran.
    This is heralded as a significant milestone in overthrowing American hegemony and imperialism in the Middle East.
  </p>


  <h2>Combat</h2>
  <p>Nilou is limited to dendro-hydro bloom teams given her passive,
    which activates when there are only dendro and hydro units on the team (and at least one of each, so not mono).
    If Kokomi was restricted due to her -100% cr, then Nilou is restricted by this passive and her possible teams.
    But at least Nilou can crit.
  </p><p>
    Similar to Yelan, much of Nilou's damage scales with her HP.
    Yelan can often be used on Nilou teams given both scale with HP, and the new hydro resonance (3.0) buffs HP.
    Any other hydro character can be paired with Nilou too: Mona, Childe, Barbara, Kokomi, etc.
    However, Nilou's E does not work with Candace's Q.
  </p><p>
    Bloom is a transformative reaction which usually does not benefit from crit or atk,
    but depends on level, EM, and res.
  </p>


  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>Nilou's E does a stance change and gives a hydro infusion.
    Like Ayato, Nilou cannot charge attack in this stance.
    Her E does not proc Candace's Q.
    Either two things can happen during her E. 
    If you use a NA in the third step, she will gain an infusion and can unleash water waves with her NA.
    If you use an E in the third step, her E will end and she will create a water ring that applies wet to surroundings
    (similar to Barbara's E).
  </p><p>
    With her passive, during her E she can activate the Golden Chalice, which increases EM and modifies the bloom reaction. 
    With Golden Chalice, bloom reactions create bountiful cores that explode immediately (usually dendro cores explode after a few seconds).
  </p><p>
    Nilou's other passive (Dreamy Dance of Aeons) increases the bloom damage based on her HP (HP needs to be above 30k for effect to kick in).
    Nilou ascends with HP and has a pretty high base hp, so it is possible to reach over 30k hp.
    Nilou has lower base hp than Hu Tao.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nilou's Q is a nuke that scales with her HP.
    It is split in two parts (the second being the Aeon damage).
  </p>

  <p>The E is called the Dance of Haftkarsvar.
    Here Haftkarsvar refers to the seven realms in Persian culture.
  </p><p>
    Her NA is called Dance of Samser.
    Here Samser may refer to Shamshir (شمشیر), or curved Persian swords.
    These swords have an origin from the Eurasian steppe and Central Asia (think Turkic, Mongol nomads).
    In Chinese the NA name is written as 弦月舞步 which sort of means 'curved moon dance'
    where the curved moon can refer to the shape of the curved Shamshir sword.
  </p>

  <p>They say that Nilou practices the arts, something that is hard to quantify for the scholars of the Akademiya,
    but for Nilou the arts is one of the simplest and purest things.
  </p>
  <p>Overall Nilou has an interesting artistic design, but her major drawback and Achilles heel
    is that her kit severely restricts her to a very niche and specific kind of team.
    It does not help that Nilou suffered from several major nerfs during the beta.
  </p>

  <h2>Constellations</h2>
  <p>C2 (Starry Skies Their Flowers Rain 星天的花雨) can shred dendro and hydro res by 35% by doing hydro and bloom dmg through the passive.
    This is a pretty good C2. It shreds more dendro res than deepwood while also shredding some hydro res.
    The C2 hydro res shred can also compensate for how many Nilou bloom comps may not have an anemo vv unit.
  </p>
  <p>C6 (断霜的弦歌) gives cr and cd that scales with her HP, up to 30 cr and 60 cd (120 cv).
    This is pretty good as a stat buff.
  </p><p>
    C1 buffs E dmg and extends duration of the water ring.
    C4 gives energy and buffs dmg of E.
  </p>

  <h2>Builds</h2>
  <p>Full HP for bloom build.
    HP sands, hydro dmg goblet, crit circlet for nuke build.
    Can also mix and match EM sands, HP goblet, crit circlet
    or full EM
    or double EM + HP
    or double HP + EM
    according to specific needs.
  </p><p>
    She has a number of options for artifact sets:
    2p gilded/WT for EM and bloom buff, 2p or 4p heart of depth, 2p tenacity, 2p noblesse for burst dmg,
    and combinations thereof.
    Echoes is the worst set to use as she does not scale much off ATK.
  </p><p>
    Nilou's signature weapon Khaj-Nisut has a good effect (沉入沙海的史诗): 
    it gives HP and then gives EM to her and the whole team based on her HP. 
    The effect is much better than that of Kokomi's extremely niche signature weapon.
  </p><p>
    The Xiphos, Jingjin sword, jade cutter, iron sting, favonius are also good options.
    Apparently, sac sword can also work.
    Big shout out to Xiphos for having one of the most broken effects in the game.
  </p>

  <p>In her 3.1 trial, Nilou was wearing 2p Gilded + 2p Tenacity.</p>


  <h2>Calculations</h2>

  <h3>Bloom damage</h3>
  <p>The base bloom damage at lv90 is 2893.70 (same as overloaded, note this factors in LM and RM, see <a href='elements.html'>elements</a>).
    The EM bonus is
    $$m = 16EM/(EM+2000)$$
    The EM used is the one who procced the bloom reaction.
    For an enemy with 10% dendro res, the res multiplier is .9.
    With the Golden Chalice effect, all party members get 100 EM.
    If you use Nilou's signature Khaj weapon, she can give more EM to other party members.
    It may not be the case that Nilou herself procs bloom all the time.
    Her teammates could be the ones proccing bloom, in which case their EM is factored in.
    To be conservative, let's assume that we have just 100 EM above.
    Then the EM bonus is 
    $$m = 0.7619047619$$ 
    or nearly doubling the damage.
    Note if everyone has 300 EM then the em bonus is 2.0869565217 (or nearly tripling the damage).
  </p>
  <p>In general, if you want to base team damage on a 
    'symmetric' or 'bidirectional' transformative reaction like
    electro-charged, overloaded, superconduct, burning, or bloom, 
    it is better to give EM to the whole team
    since you do not necessarily know who is going to proc the reaction.
    By contrast for 'asymmetric' reactions like swirl, vape, melt, spread, aggravate, 
    it is clearer who is the one proccing the reaction (clearer what is the forward direction).
  </p>
  <p>
    The Golden Chalice effect starts after the 3rd step of her E and lasts for 30s.
    During this time, bloom will produce bountiful cores that explode immediately and have larger aoe.
    This basically allows Nilou's team to spam bloom more frequently.
    Note bountiful cores and dendro cores both have a finite limit of 5 so it is not quadratic
    (only 5 cores can exist at a time).
    Normal dendro cores explode after 6s.
    Cores deal dendro damage but will not proc bloom themselves 
    (so no infinite cycle of blooms if it is raining on a target for example).
  </p><p>
    Suppose Nilou has 50k hp (if you do full hp build you can even reach 70-80k),
    so that she is 20k over 30k hp.
    From her other passive, the conversion rate is 9% dmg bonus per 1k points above 30k.
    So bloom gets 180% dmg bonus (the max dmg bonus is 400% which is achieved at around 74-75k hp).
    Thus the bountiful core will do
    $$d = 2893.70*(1 + m + 1.8)*.9 = 9276.4$$
    (true) damage. To convert this to mv we divide by 4000, so the above is around 232% mv
    $$x_t = 232$$
    That is assuming you create one core every second.
  </p>
  <p>To play Nilou as a bloom dps, you only need to build hp and em on her.
    It is that simple.
    Her E and Q scale with her hp and can crit,
    but much of her dps will come from her bloom.
  </p>
  <p>The Q has 33.18+40.55=73.73% hp scaling at lv10.
    This is roughly equivalent to 737.3% atk scaling.
    The cd is 18s and energy cost 70.
    In bloom teams with only hydro or dendro, this will usually not vape.
    If you are not building any hydro dmg on Nilou the dps is then
    $$x_q = 737.3/18 = 40.96$$
    which is not much, even for a nuke.
  </p><p>
    As such, you only need to ascend her to lv90 to maximize the bloom damage
    and activate the Golden Chalice passive.
    Whether her E or Q are lv1 or lv9, the bountiful core dmg will be the same.
  </p>
