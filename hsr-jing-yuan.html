  <h2>Jing Yuan (JY) in Genshin</h2>
  <p>The key is to replicate the lightning lord (LL).
    In Genshin, JY can have a passive where the LL deals damage say every 60s.
    By default it deals 3 hits of damage with say 100% scaling each (at lv10 Q).
    When JY uses E, it does an aoe slash that increases the LL hits per action by 2 while decreasing its cd by 15s.
    When JY uses Q, it does a larger aoe slash with higher scaling that increases the LL hits per action by 3 while decreasing its cd by 30s.
    The max hits per action is 10 (at c0).
    The E can have a 10s cd, and the Q can have 40-60 energy.
    Each hit by the LL can be an aoe blast strike on a random enemy within a certain range (say 10-20m). 
    After the LL attacks, it resets to 3 hits per action, and the 60s timer restarts.
  </p><p>
    Similar to Raiden's chakra wheel, JY can have a wheel indicating how much time is left before the LL strikes.
    This charka wheel can be on field all the time.
    Or if one wants, JY can summon chakra the first time the E is used with the LL starting with 3 stacks.
    The chakra will stay on field for 60s, after which it disappears if no E or Q is used.
    This can prevent the LL from randomly taking action in the middle of say quest dialogue.
  </p>

  <p>Jing Yuan has a very simple design in HSR. His skill is aoe, his burst is aoe, his LL does blasts on random enemies.
    The LL is the thing with very high scaling, giving Jing Yuan high single target damage besides aoe damage.
  </p><p>
    In Genshin, one can add embellishments to the JY replica.
    Say his Q gives him electro infusion (for say 10s).
    When JY uses his NA, it can decrease the LL cd by 2s at a time (icd of 1s).
    Another passive allows his Q to reset the E cd.
    Or one can decrease the E cd by .6s for every stack the LL has.
  </p><p>
    C1 can give an extra charge on the E.
    C2 can increase the max number of stacks from 10 to 20. It can also make the LL start with 6 stacks by default rather than 3.
    C4 can increase JY's damage bonus by 10% for each stack LL has (up to 100%).
    C6 can make the LL have a 50% chance not to consume a stack every time it hits.
    Also when the LL has more than 10 stacks, it will do coordinated attacks with the active character every 2s.
    The scaling of this coordinated attack is 100% and increases by 10% for each additional stack above 10 (up to 200% scaling).
  </p><p>
    One can also have a passive/constellation that increases the number of stacks that the E and Q give (to say 4 and 6).
    Or when JY uses electro-infused NA, there is 20% chance to increase stacks of LL by 1 (icd of 1s).
  </p><p>
    Or when party members deal damage (use their NA/E/Q) they can increase the number of stacks of LL by 1.
    This way JY does not need to be on field all the time.
  </p>

  <p>The LL is a kind of subdps that will proc even when JY is off-field.
    It does damage automatically and deterministically.
    So JY does not need to be like an on-field hypercarry.
