  <h2>Jing Yuan (JY) in Genshin</h2>
  <p>The key is to replicate the lightning lord (LL).
    In Genshin, JY can have a passive where the LL deals damage say every 60s.
    By default it deals 3 hits of damage with say 100% scaling each.
    When JY uses E, it does an aoe slash that increases the LL hits per action by 2 while decreasing its cd by 15s.
    When JY uses Q, it does a larger aoe slash with higher scaling that increases the LL hits per action by 3 while decreasing its cd by 30s.
    The max hits per action is 10 (at c0).
    The E can have a 10s cd, and the Q can have 40-60 energy.
    Each hit by the LL can be an aoe blast strike on a random enemy within a certain range (say 10-20m). 
  </p><p>
    Similar to Raiden's chakra wheel, JY can have a wheel indicating how much time is left before the LL strikes.
    This charka wheel can be on field all the time.
    Or if one wants, JY can summon chakra the first time the E is used.
    The chakra will stay on field for 60s, after which it disappears if no E or Q is used.
    This can prevent the LL from randomly taking action in the middle of say quest dialogue.
