<h2>Talents</h2>
<p>Her healing scales with her ATK. She can heal through her E, Q, and passive.</p>

<h2>Build</h2>
<p>Ocean Clam (released in Version 2.3) 4 piece is her bis.  
  Before that Noblesse Oblige or even Blizzard Strayer could also work.
</p><p>
  ATK/ER sands, ATK/Cryo DMG goblet, Healing bonus circlet.
  Substats: ATK, ER > CRIT.
  More ATK and healing bonus means more healing and bubble damage.
  ER is for getting her 80 cost burst more easily and if one already has enough ATK.
  Because she can crit (unlike Kokomi), crit substats can sometimes be ok for additional damage.
  However the bubble damage does not crit.
  CRIT and Cryo DMG are really for her burst damage (which actually has decent scaling).
  But to maximize her healing specifically (and bubble damage), ATK goblet and Healing bonus circlet are usually preferred.
  Note she gains healing bonus upon ascension.
</p><p>
  Sacrificial Sword is good for resetting her E's cd.
  Any sword that gives a lot of attack is also good (such as Aquilla Favonia).
  ER swords such as Skyward or Favonius are also good.
</p>

<h2>Teams</h2>
<p>
  She can be a healer for pretty much any team (except maybe Hu Tao teams).
  </p><p>
  Since she is usually run with the Ocean clam set,
  pairing Qiqi with an Electro applier such as Raiden, Fischl, or Beidou
  will proc Superconduct, reducing Physical RES by 40%, and increasing her bubble's damage.
  In fact, Raiden is one of Qiqi's best teammates to trigger Superconduct and charge up her 80 cost burst.
  </p><p>
  Because of this synergy, Qiqi can be used in Eula-Raiden teams for Cryo resonance and healing.
  </p><p>
    Qiqi can also be used in a taser team: Qiqi-Beidou-Fischl-Xingqiu
    where Qiqi is the on field auto-attacker 
    and Beidou-Fischl provide off field Electro DMG.
