  <p>Mr. Yang is the physicist that accompanies the trailblazer on the astral express.</p>

  <h2>The greatest Chinese physicist of the modern era</h2>
  <p>
    Chen Ning Yang (C. N. Yang), the Nobel Prize winner, is perhaps most famous for inventing Yang-Mills gauge theory,
    a theory that describes three of the forces of nature: the electromagnetic U(1), strong SU(3), and weak SU(2) force.
    The electromagnetic force follows an abelian guage theory, while the strong and weak forces follow nonabelian gauge theories.
    These are used in quantum field theory, an area where C. N. Yang did a lot of his most famous work.
    The modern holy grail of physics is to find a theory that describes the four forces of nature, including gravity.
    Yang-Mills already describes three of the four, so if somehow gravity can be described using the Yang-Mills framework, then that would be a milestone in physics.
    But it has not yet been done due to 'technical difficulties'. What he have currently is something called string theory.
