  <h2>Genshin equivalent</h2>
  <p>Bronya buffs dmg bonus with skill and crit dmg and atk with burst.
    She falls into the special class of supports called 'universal buffers'.
    That is, she can be used in basically any team to buff damage.
    In Genshin, as of version 3.8, there are only 3 universal buffers: 
    Bennett (atk), Mona (dmg bonus), Morax (res shred).
    We merge harmony and nihility into a broader 'buffer' class.
    The above 3 characters can be used in almost any team and buff damage.
  </p><p>
    Sometimes Raiden (ER, burst dmg) and Nahida (EM, reaction crit) may count.
    And Venti (nihility) is more of a crowd control unit than buffer.
  </p>
  <p>To say the least, adding a Bronya equivalent in Genshin would augment the meta.
    Bronya could be used in many different teams.
    As of version 3, it seems Genshin wants to maintain the monopoly that Bennett, Mona have
    and be selective about what kinds of new universal buffers it adds to the game.
