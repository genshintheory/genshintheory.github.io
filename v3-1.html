<h2>King Deshret and the Three Magi</h2>
<p>Version 3.1 will introduce the desert region of <a href='sumeru.html'>Sumeru</a>
  as well as Cyno, Nilou, and Candace.
</p>

<p>
  There are a number of huge flaws introduced by the 3.1 special program:
  1) remove Ganyu from the credit card and bankrupt the bank that had such an idiotic idea.
  2) remove Kazuha from the Cadillac endorsement. Cadillac and GM is a dying brand and fell off ever since Jack Welch left GM.
  3) remove Kazuha nori from the Genshin Concert picture and replace him with someone more likeable like Xiao.
  They're both anemo and they plunge, so Xiao can easily replace Kazuha anywhere.
  4) remove zhongli, tighnari, dori, hunt down everyone close to them and execute their entire families.
  5) remove xingqiu from the game and genocide everybody named zhu, qiu, chu.
  6) execute everybody who designed tighnari, dori, kazuha, yoshinori, and put their entire families in jail and kill all their descendants so they go extinct.
</p><p>
  The Genshin marketing team is essentially saying: we would rather kill ourselves and put kazuha in the picture.
  If that's the case, then use kazuha to kill off their entire marketing team.
  See who's laughing then.
