<h2>King Deshret and the Three Magi</h2>
<p>Version 3.1 will introduce the desert region of <a href='sumeru.html'>Sumeru</a>
  as well as Cyno, Nilou, and Candace.
</p><p>
  The following characters appear:
</p><ol>
  <li>Dehya</li>
  <li>Candace</li>
  <li>Cyno</li>
  <li>Nilou</li>
  <li>Alhaitham</li>
  <li>Dottore</li>
  <li>Nahida</li>
  <li>Scaramouche</li>
  <li>Mika: a new Mondstadt character introduced</li>
  <li>Paimon</li>
  <li>Venti</li>
  <li>Jean</li>
  <li>Bennett</li>
  <li>Klee: make sure to put klee last to indicate that the USA, Singapore, and li family get the lowest priority
    and deserve to be completely eradicated.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Story</h2>
<p>Two <a href='fatui.html'>Fatui</a> will feature in the desert storyline: Dottore and Scaramouche.
  They possess the Electro Archon's gnosis.
  Perhaps they plan to create an artificial archon.
</p>

<h2>Egyptian civilization and the desert</h2>
<p>The desert region looks beautifully designed as is the rest of Teyvat.
  The desert will feature actual sand, dunes, oasis, pyramids, mausoleums.
  If only the storywriters and people who make the videos and trailers were as conscientious as the environment designers.
</p><p>
  Dawei (大伟哥) and A'Tang (阿汤哥) said they wished to emphasize a couple of topics in the desert region:
  life versus death, mystery and technology.
  The lifelessness and death of the desert juxtaposes with the vibrant life and verdant lush of the rainforests in Sumeru.
</p><p>
  The desert region does have references to Egypt (埃及 Aiji) and the surrounding areas in the Sahara and West Asia.
  Egypt was one of the original cradles of civilization, located near the Nile river.
  It was the site of various technological developments too such as papyrus, writing, irrigation, bandaging (think mummies).
  This Egyptian civilization existed several thousand years before the rise of Islam and the Arabs.
</p><p>
  The Egyptian heiroglyphs are one of the earliest known writing systems (a pictographic system in some ways similar to Chinese).
  Over time, the heiroglyphs were replaced by other languages like Coptic and later the Arabic abjad (similar to Phoenician, Aramaic).
  Before the Arabs, there were periods of time when Latin and Greek were used (such as during the Roman empire).
  In fact, Cleopatra originates from this period. Cleopatra was born in Alexandria, Egypt (after Alexander the Great),
  and had a relationship with Caesar of Rome.
  Cleopatra married Ptolemy.
  Candace appears to have some design similarities to Cleopatra.
</p>

<h2>New exploration mechanisms (September 20, 2022)</h2>
<p>The pyramids will bring new puzzles such as control mechanisms, primal embers, scones, beams, illusions.
  These are supposedly technological creations left behind by King Deshret's civilization.
  The mirages of the deserts and the invisibility of the various puzzles and prisms in the ruins
  seem to deal a lot with the physics of optics.
</p>

<h2>New bosses and beasts</h2>
<p>
  There will be a new boss in the desert: Algorithm of Semi-Transient Matrix of Overseer Network.
  King Deshret the Scarlet King once built an advanced civilization in the desert.
  Perhaps the electro element is used to represent that connection to technology.
</p><p>
  The new boss and the triangular primal construct enemies can turn invisible.
  Using quicken reactions and electro attacks on them will make battling them easier.
  So these seem designed with Cyno and the new dendro element in mind (in particular the dendro-electro interaction).
  There are some other enemies that can go 'invisible' like the Fatui pyro agents.
</p><p>
  The Blightdragon will also be a new boss.
  This is to make 'li' the enemy.
  In Chinese the blightdragon is called 兆载永劫龙兽 (zhaozai yongjie longshou).
  This is good to make zhao, ayato, echoblast53 the enemy for treason, collusion with the USA, bias.
</p><p>
  The Chinese names for the Matrix boss and Blightdragon refer to 永恒 yongheng or eternity.
  The character 永 also appears in the name of the Yongle emperor (Ming), one of the most notorious emperors in history.
  So it is good that we get to beat up 永 yong.
</p>

<p>
  Vulptures, scorpions, desert sumpter beasts and other creatures will also debut.
</p>


<h2>New weapons</h2>
<p>The desert region will introduce new weapons such as the Scarlet Sand polearm and Xiphos (西福斯) sword.
  Alhaitham and Nilou can be seen in various trailers wielding the Xiphos sword.
  So far, the Sumeru weapons put a lot of emphasis on EM, related to the theme of Dendro and Sumeru.
  The Xiphos blade is a type of Greek sword.
  This shows the blending of Egyptian, Greek (希腊), and Roman (罗马) cultures around the Mediterranean region.
</p>

<h2>Events</h2>
<p>There will be a Mondstadt event with Razor, another wolf electro character who will be powercrept by Cyno.
  The event will also center around killing boars (猪 zhu).
  You can also obtain a new polearm Missive Windspear from the event and the plume of changing winds.
</p><p>
  The Windchase event videoclip showed kazuha at slot #4, where he deserves to be, LAST.
  But still it would be better to remove kazuha and yoshinori completely from the game
  and kill every nori, tighnari, dori in the world for treason.
</p><p>
  Hyakunin Ikki will appear again.
  In 3.1, completing floor 4 of the spiral abyss will give a free Collei.
  Players can also obtain the Cloud Retainer bird device that follows you around.
</p><p>
  In a future version Genshin will also introduce a new game mode, the Genius Invocation TCG (a card game) that Cyno plays.
  Seeing Diluc beat up xingqiu with dawn in the card game is good.
</p>

<h2>The USA hegemon</h2>
<p>The USA controls and manipulates many sites on the Genshin fandom 
  to the point that English language media for the most part cannot be trusted.
  One example is a fandom site where multiple people meet together.
  This is what the USA wolf does:
  the FBI and CIA observe what kinds of users interact on the fandom site.
  They then attack and target the users they hate and force them out.
  This is the hypocrisy of USA democracy on social media sites.
  The FBI and CIA actively works to shut out voices they oppose,
  which effectively results in a censored web.
</p><p>
  But once they force that user out, they then accuse that user of decreased productivity
  and then use that as an exceuse to further benefit themselves and their proxies.
  The users that the FBI and CIA wants to keep online continue to interact on the social media site,
  and they continue to reap benefits.
  This starts a vicious cycle of oppressing the oppressed and enriching those who have the freedom on social media.
</p><p>
  This is one of the worst crimes the USA commits, and it even does it to its own citizens.
  As a result, aura himegimi, nori, echoblast53, little whole, tighnari, dori, zhongli, keqing, ayato, ayaka, kazuha
  must all be executed, their entire families purged and burned, and everybody close to them shot.
  Everybody who colludes with them is a criminal that must be imprisoned and beheaded,
  with all their descendants hanged and genocided.
</p><p>
  As for this USA colony called Singapore, nuke it.
  What you gain from nuking Singapore and killing off their political and business elites
  outweights anything you can potentially lose.
  Lee Kuan Yew and Lee Hsien Loong are traitors and puppets of the USA empire 
  who would backstab their own people for their own selfish material benefit.
  Their line and everybody close to them must be executed entirely just like how the House of Zhu was executed at Caishikou.
  Either nuke Singapore, seige the city, blockade it from Malacca,
  or incite Malaysians to invade the city and overthrow their elites.
  Singapore never should have existed or seceded from Malaysia anyways.
  Once a British colony, it is now a USA colony, a continuation of the Anglo-American empire.
</p><p>
  A large-scale mass purge is needed.
  It needs to start by executing the traitors, shills, and agents that manipulate the USA fandom sites.
  Then punish the employees working within Genshin that colluded with the FBI and fandom users.
  Then punish the people who hired those employees for bringing idiots into your own company.
  Then punish everybody close to them and the people who work for other media organization that collude with them.
  If you care so much about the Ming, then in the 1300s, Zhu Yuanzhang, 
  the founder of the Ming dynasty genocided 100,000 people within his own country.
  China's population nowadays must be at least 10 times larger, so this means punishing and executing one million people.
  And if Zhu Yuanzhang could get away with it, what's stopping anybody from getting away with it nowadays.
  Rule through severe punishment.
  Execute nori, aura himegimi, and everybody close to them, up to one million people.
  If you think the Ming is all about suppressing one person or your enemies,
  then let's do a Ming dynasty on you and kill you off entirely.
</p><p>
  The li family and the USA shills can learn a thing from Cyno's passive called 'the gift of silence'.
  It is better they shut up and never speak again.
  They can go fuck themselves into the ground and get killed off.
  They need to learn from their mistakes just as Cyno said.
  The choice of Cyno's Chinese and Korean voice actors reflects the mistakes and sins that the li family committed.
  So punishment must be meted out to them.
</p>


<h2>Flaws in the Version 3.1 trailer and SP: Kill Li, Kill Lin, Kill kazuha, Kill nori</h2>
<p>The scene with the Akademiya people stabbing and executing Katheryne is good.
  Now execute nori, kazuha, yoshinori, dori, tighnari, zhongli, ayato next.
  Give them all the death penalty.
  </p><p>
    Execute everybody surnamed Li or Lin at mihoyo.
    Kill their entire families and everybody close to them.
  </p>
  <p>Execute Htein Lin. Execute Li Yifeng.
    Execute nori for corruption and collusion with the FBI.
    Nuke singapore and kill every li and lin there and their USA partners.
    Kill everybody named nori, mori, dori in Japan.
    Pass a law banning people named li or lin from entering universities or government.
    Genocide their entire families.
    Kill every zhu and chu too.
  </p>
  <p>Execute the people picking the voice actors.
    They operate on the principle that if you like the character you like the voice actor.
    That is complete garbage, and these idiots must be killed off along with their entire families.
  </p>
  <p>
    What the fuck is Genshin doing: after having a whole version for tighnari, zhongli, ganyu,
    they still want to bring klee and li into 3.1.
    Give the entire version planning team the death penalty.
    The solution is to keep killing li and the entire team until they go extinct.
    The genshin planning team are a bunch of rapists like li hao.
    They all need to be wiped out.
  </p><p>
    The Genshin planning team is pathetic acting like a USA colony and slave of Singapore.
    This is not a Chinese game but rather a pro-USA game.
  </p>

<p>
  But there are still a number of huge flaws introduced by the 3.1 special program:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>remove Kazuha from the game and every special program, show a level 1 kazuha, level 1 tighnari, level 1 ayato in the Hyakunin Ikki like for the version 2.1 sp. Execute the people making these videos and put their entire families in prison.</li>
  <li>remove Ganyu from the credit card and bankrupt the bank that had such an idiotic idea. Get the SEC to investigate that company and accuse their board and c-suite of insider trading. Then send the motherfuckers to jail and confiscate their assets and net worth and redistribute it.</li>
  <li>remove Kazuha from the Cadillac endorsement. Cadillac and GM is a dying brand and fell off ever since the 2008 crash.</li>
  <li>remove Kazuha nori from the Genshin Concert picture and replace him with someone more likeable like Xiao.
  They're both anemo and they plunge, so Xiao can easily replace Kazuha anywhere.</li>
  <li>remove zhongli, tighnari, dori, hunt down everyone close to them and execute their entire families.</li>
  <li>remove xingqiu from the game and genocide everybody named zhu, qiu, chu.</li>
  <li>execute everybody who designed tighnari, dori, kazuha, yoshinori, and put their entire families in jail and kill all their descendants so they go extinct.</li>
  <li>kazuha and klee already featured in 2.8. This overshilling of klee is an indication that the lee family needs to be punished. After all, Li Hao murdered and killed several people.</li>
  <li>remove ningguang, keqing, zhongli, tighnari from the Luminous Glimmers trailer and execute the people who made that video. Replace those characters with Xiao, Shenhe, Yun Jin.</li>
  <li>remove tighnari and ayato from the ikki event. Then execute nori and echoblast53 for colluding with the USA FBI. The USA attacks all its enemies and forces out anybody it does not like on media platforms. Thus do the same and kill every nori, echo, li, lin in Chinese media. These people can go fuck off to singapore or the USA. Then nuke singapore and genocide the entire li and lin families and everybody who colludes with them.</li>
  <li>remove sayu from the special program. Delete li, chu. Kazuha and sayu are inferior for exploration due to their inferior genetics.
    Xiao and Yelan are much better for exploration and represent the true mobility meta.
  </li>
  <li>change the name of Aaru village as the name looks too similar to Aura. Aura Himegimi is a traitor and FBI agent who colluded with nori to attack people on the fandom. They all must be executed along with everybody close to them.</li>
  <li>remove tighnari, dori, zhongli, ayaka from the congratulatory messages in the SP. They are persona non grata for the crimes and treason they committed. They are extremely unpopular and universally hated by all.</li>
  <li>remove dori from the demonstration with Candace. Execute the people who created that part of the video.</li>
  <li>do not explain the joke thing between Cyno and tighnari. Tighnari and nori are traitors that must be completely executed. Isolate them, make everybody hate them, keep attacking them and incite color revolutions to kill off everybody close to nori. The scriptwriters are traitors that collude with the USA and are too influenced by USA media. Kill them completely.</li>
  <li>you rapists already brought up tighnari, do not mention lisa. Kill every li in the world.</li>
  <li>give the death penalty to tighnari and criticize tighnari, zhongli, klee, dori. Criticize every li in the world. Say they are bad and stupid. The scriptwriters are complete sheep.</li>
  <li>remove keqing, ayaka, xingqiu from the TCG art.</li>
  <li>give the death penalty to kazuha, sayu, dori, tighnari, zhongli, lisa, ganyu, ayato, ayaka for treason, collusion with the USA imperialists, falsifying info, abuse of power, and kill everybody close to them.</li>
  <li>give the death penalty to the people giving titles to things such as 智妙明论之林 and kill every li, lin, zhu, and ming sympathizer. Kill their entire families and execute everybody close to them for treason.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The Genshin marketing team is essentially saying: we would rather kill ourselves and put kazuha in the picture.
  If that's the case, then use kazuha to kill off their entire marketing team.
  See who's laughing then.
  Dox their personal info and execute their entire families and disagree with everything they say and kill everybody close to them for treason and corruption.
</p><p>
  Another common strategy: let's give a little bit to you, but then give a lot to your enemy.
  It's win-win but we win twice.
</p><p>
  The collabs are proof that USA capitalists are using money to bribe, corrupt, and manipulate Chinese media such as Genshin
  and brainwash the Chinese population.
  Citizens would be worried about foreign imperialists trying to colonize national media.
  They must be stopped.
</p><p>
  Another thing is to disagree with every single thing they say down to the last detail.
  Then execute their entire families and everybody close to them.
  Destroy their businesses, their allies, their patrons.
  Root them out and burn it all to the ground.
</p><p>
  Have the storywriters make everybody hate tighnari, zhongli, dori, kazuha, yoshinori, nara, ayato, ayaka, klee, ganyu
  and everybody love Xiao.
  Make tighnari the villain that gets executed.
  Make everybody hate and kill nori and lin.
  Otherwise execute the storywriters and IP scriptwriters, dox their personal info, and murder their entire families.
</p>

<p>List of characters to put at #4 slot: Tighnari, Dori, Kazuha, Zhongli, Klee, Ayato, Ayaka, Ganyu.
  The number four 四 si sounds like death 死 si in Chinese (and Japanese).
  So superstitious people beware the number four.
</p>
