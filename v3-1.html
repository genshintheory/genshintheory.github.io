<h2>King Deshret and the Three Magi</h2>
<p>Version 3.1 introduced the desert region of <a href='sumeru.html'>Sumeru</a>
  as well as Cyno, Nilou, and Candace.
</p><p>
  The following characters appear:
</p><ol>
  <li>Dehya (Chen Yu 陈雨 / Amber May)</li>
  <li>Candace (Zhang Qi 张琦 / Shara Kirby)</li>
  <li>Cyno (Alejandro Saab)</li>
  <li>Nilou</li>
  <li>Alhaitham</li>
  <li>Dottore</li>
  <li>Nahida</li>
  <li>Scaramouche</li>
  <li>Mika (Deng Youxi 邓宥希): a new Mondstadt character introduced</li>
  <li>Paimon</li>
  <li>Venti</li>
  <li>Jean</li>
  <li>Bennett</li>
  <li>Klee</li>
</ol>


<h2>Story</h2>
<p>Two <a href='fatui.html'>Fatui</a> will feature in the desert storyline: Dottore and Scaramouche.
  They possess the Electro Archon's gnosis.
  Perhaps they plan to create an artificial archon.
</p>

<h3>Chapter 3 Act 3</h3>
<p>
  We meet with Nahida (disguised as Katheryne) and follow Setaria.
  Setaria's name means 'Star'.
  Star was born in the desert and was hailed as their greatest genius.
  Star went to the Akademiya and started working for them.
  The traveler and Nahida devise a scheme to get Star to go against the Akademiya
  and return to her roots in the desert and King Deshret.
</p><p>
  Using the Akasha terminals, Nahida possesses three people close to Star:
  Nabiya, Akim, and Qishan.
  They work together to convince Star to go against the Akademiya and side with King Deshret,
  who supposedly will have a resurrection.
</p><p>
  Star tries to report to Rima, one of the Corps of Thirty
  about the Scarlet King infiltrating the minds of Sumeru people,
  but Nahida also possesses and impersonates Rima,
  convincing Star to oppose the Akademiya Sages' samsara project of harvesting dreams.
</p><p>
  However, the next day the traveler and Nahida encounter a mob brainwashed by Dottore.
  Dottore is able to manipulate the Akasha terminals to control the thoughts of the masses,
  so he made them believe that the traveler is a hero.
  Nahida says that what the Doctor was doing was akin to creating hallucinations within their minds,
  which Nahida was able to fix.
</p><p>
  Paimon says that Dottore's strength is able to make him number two of the harbingers.
  So based on this, Dottore will probably be stronger than Signora and Tartaglia.
</p><p>
  The traveler escapes the city and heads to Pardis Dhyai.
  They meet Haypasia, who woke up from her meditation and gained new insights into a supposed 'god'.
  Haypasia says she can help the traveler understand what they saw in the Irminsul.
  The traveler and Nahida look into Haypasia's consciousness and they see the memories of Scaramouche, the Balladeer.
</p><p>
  Scaramouche says he was betrayed three times in his life:
  once by his creator and mother (the Raiden Shogun),
  once by a human,
  and once by a kid (who died early).
  Since then Scaramouche has been filled with loathing to humans and the gods
  and seeks to eliminate every last trace of human emotion.
</p><p>
  (Recall Scaramouche was initially a puppet prototype for the Raiden Shogun.)
</p><p>
  Haypasia is a huge simp and is full of adoration towards Scaramouche.
  Traveler and Nahida find out that the Akademiya and Dottore are planning to create a new artificial god
  with Scaramouche and the gnosis, and a scene of a gundam robot with Scaramouche in it appears.
  The concept of an artificial god is something Childe also tried to pursue in Liyue,
  and we learned about it before from Dainsleif with the Fieldtiller in the ruins of old Mondstadt.
  By making Scaramouche a new artificial god, that could be seen as a kind of vengance
  for what he was originally supposed to be: the Electro Archon.
  Note that he refers to Raiden Shogun as his 'mother'.
</p><p>
  The Corps of Thirty (referred to as Akademiya government lapdogs) then ambush the traveler.
  The traveler demonstrates their martial prowess,
  but the Corps of Thirty then stab and kill Katheryne, that puppet.
  Nice.
</p><p>
  Fortunately, Nahida was able to swap consciousness with the traveler
  and escaped unscathed.
  The traveler escapes to Caravan Ribat, while Nahida is back at the city sanctuary facing Scaramouche and Dottore.
</p><p>
  At the caravan, the traveler encounters the Wall of Samiel,
  which was built to block the desert's sand around Rukkhadevata's time.
  The traveler also meets Alhaitham once again and escapes from Eremites who were trailing them.
  Alhaitham says he is interested in learning more about the Divine Knowledge Capsul (from Port Ormos).
  The capsul is said to have originated from the desert, so Alhaitham is also interested in going there with the traveler.
</p><p>
  They head to the desert Aar village, and Cyno and Alhaitham have a duel.
  Cyno uses his Scarlet Sand King polearm, and Alhaitham uses the Xiphos sword.
  Dehya enters to break up the fight.
  Candace invites them all into her place to chat.
  </p><p>
    Cyno, General Mahamatra of the Akademiya, previously issued an audit 
    to investigate some of the dubious works done by the sages related to Azar.
    Cyno knew the sages were up to something suspicious so he made his own investigation into the desert.
    Alhaitham also worked with the sages to investigate the traveler,
    which is how Cyno and Alhaitham ended up dueling.
    But Alhaitham reveals that he too was suspicious of the sages, seeing how they were dealing with the
    Divine Knowledge Capsule and Ayn Al-Ahmar,
    so in the end Cyno and Alhaitham both had a common nemesis in the Akademiya.
    Cyno also senses that Alhaitham had the capsule on him the whole time.
  </p><p>
    They were also discussing how suspicious and untrusthworthy tighnari was
    and how they should arrest and imprison tighnari for life for abuse of power, bribery, treason, collusion with foreigners.
    Moreover tighnari is a clown that is universally hated by the community.
    A good story would be Cyno putting tighnari in prison.
  </p>

  <h3>Chapter 3 Act 4</h3>
  <p>
    The traveler and Cyno examine the surroundings of the village to find whereabouts on the village keepers,
    including Isak's 'grandpa'.
    These village keepers were maniacs expelled by the Akademiya.
    But when they arrived at the desert village, they magically rehabilitated.
    The traveler and Cyno conclude that it is Nahida, the dendro archon, who was helping cleanse them
    by possessing them via the Akasha terminal.
  </p><p>
    They also meet some other people in the desert village and caravan.
    Jabari, the duck fucking crook, is a mean jerk that will be put in prison.
    Zaki is a suspicious slimebucket who deceives the traveler and Dehya and lures them into a trap.
    Zaki and his cronies had been eavesdropping on Dehya's conversations with the traveler.
    Zaki's motive was to band together the desert people to overthrow the Akademiya to avenge the Scarlet King.
    Dehya and the traveler beat up Zaki and his accomplices.
    Dehya knocks Zaki unconscious.
  </p><p>
    Dehya says that anybody can be her friend as long as they are paying her.
    It feels like this is what the USA capitalists are trying to say though.
    They think they can abuse money to bribe and corrupt people.
    But nori, echoblast53 need to be imprisoned for treason, abuse of power, falsifying information, 
    color revolution, corruption, bribery, collusion with the USA businesses and media.
    It is dishonest to put political opinions and thoughts into the voice of a fictional character.
    It is recommended that the entire storywriter team be investigated for discipline.
  </p><p>
    Although Dehya is also from the desert (like Cyno, Candace), she does not mind the dendro archon.
    So even among desert people there are differences and factions.
    Cyno and Candace proceed to beat up Zaki and the prisoners at the village.
    Candace lectures them saying that although she and they are both desertfolk,
    their actions were too radical as a resurrection and insurrection against the Akademiya would lead to war,
    which would lead to the loss of lives.
  </p><p>
    It is true that war does kill people, and peace can lead to stability and prosperity.
    But it is another thing for a company or business to collude with the USA to oppress their political enemies.
    The business will then try to make up an excuse saying they don't want war, they want to continue colluding with the USA
    and make money from their USA overlords, so that they can continue to oppress their political enemies.
    It is situations like these when war is needed to severe the illicit and corrupt tie
    and stop that company from abusing power to opress the people.
  </p><p>
    If the people behind mihoyo only care about money and think that USA money can bribe anybody,
    then why make Genshin a free game in the first place?
    By making Genshin free, you invite all sorts of people to play, including people who don't really want to pay to play.
    If you only want to reward whales and large businesses that pay big money,
    and you only design content to suit their interests rather than everybody else,
    then do not make the game free in the first place!
  </p><p>
    Anyways, Zaki spills the beans that a person in the cloak got Zaki and the others to lure the village keepers
    with an incense at night to kidnap them.
    This cloaked person call himself an envoy of the Scarlet King.
    Village chief Anpu and others suspect that this cloaked person was actually an Akademiya spy.
    Earlier Star mentioned that the Scarlet King's resurrection was a misinformation campaign spread by the Akademiya.
    So the cloaked person was just tricking the desert people to bring back the village keepers to the Akademiya to be used.
  </p><p>
    Meanwhile, Alhaitham returns with new insights he got from a village resident named Shani.
    At night Shani had been hearing cries and moans.
    The traveler and Alhaitham deduce that those cries were coming from a nearby hospital used for treating Eleazar patients.
    At night they go to the abandoned hospital and find a person named Razak.
    Razak was one of Alhaitham's colleagues at the Akademiya.
    He was banished from the Akademiya and became a village keeper.
    Eventually he went mad.
    It turns out that the Akademiya was extracting the knowledge from his brain to create canned knowledge capsules.
    This is how he and other village keepers went insane.
    It was similar to how that person at Ormos went insane.
  </p><p>
    The traveler deduces that the Akademiya (and Dottore) were harvesting the knowledge from their brains to create 
    an artificial god with Scaramouche.
    But it was not any knowledge. These people had to have had contact with the divine, the gods.
    It is connected to what Haypasia had mentioned earlier about the Satyavada life and paripurna.
    Alhaitham was aware of the Akademiya's project as Alhaitham is the Akademiya scribe.
    Still Alhaitham opposed the Akademiya's actions as it went against their own rules.
  </p><p>
    The traveler and Alhaitham report their findings back to the others.
    The Akademiya had used the abandoned Eleazar hospital to extract Divine Canned Knowledge.
    But they left before the traveler and the group arrived.
    Alhaitham deduces that the Akademiya was able to predict their next move because of Cyno.
    As the general mahamatra, Cyno's movements had been spied on by the Akademiya the whole time.
    Every Jnagarbha day, the Akademiya enters Cyno's info into the Akasha, 
    which allows an algorithm to predict Cyno's next moves.
    So it seems that the Akademiya is into some high tech machine learning and AI.
  </p><p>
    The group heads to the desert to search for traces of the Akademiya.
    Dehya talks with one of her desert friends, Rahman.
    Dehya tries to convince Rahman to team up with her and the others,
    saying they have a common enemy, the Akademiya sages.
    They head to a mausoleum pyramid in the middle desert and find the ruins of King Deshret,
    which surprisingly was teeming with plants and vegetation.
    They learn from the records of Kasala (priest of Deshret)
    that the Greater Lord Rukkhadevata and King Deshret were never enemies in the first place, 
    but rather friends that helped each other.
    Once Rukkhadevata even saved the desert kingdom of Deshret from a severe drought and calamity,
    and Rukkhadevata became smaller after that.
  </p><p>
    Seeing the true history of the past, Rahman realizes that the dendro archon is a friend of the desert people
    and that their true enemies were the Akademiya sages.
    So Rahman agrees to ally with Dehya and the traveler against the sages and Dottore.
    At the end, Rahman takes Dehya and others to punish Judar (朱达尔), 
    an Akademiya crook who kidnapped the village keepers.
  </p>

  <h3>The role of media in society and chain of command</h3>
  <p>It is good that Judar is the villain here.
    It is also good that Katheryne got killed.
    Otherwise, the USA has a really bad habit and bias towards the Ming dynasty and Zhu family,
    liking to overuse and abuse the words zhu, chu, ming.
    These are disgusting sounds to hear and they need to be cleansed from the people's vocabulary.
  </p><p>
    Second, it is nice seeing Dehya, Alhaitham, Cyno, the Traveler, Candace, and Rahman work together as a team.
    But some of the character interactions and fights presented in the later part of the story were a bit off and unsettling.
    It would be funnier to see a li get put in jail or arrested,
    similar to how Tariq was beat up in the previous part of the quest.
  </p><p>
    It is seriously recommended that the storywriting team be investigated.
    Where is the chain of command here? If they can just write whatever they want and spew their own personal or political opinions
    without moderation, that is harmful to society.
    There needs to be a content reviewer, a supervisor, a censor, a moderator 
    that checks everything they write before it is published to the world. 
    If you are a media organization and you have a global audience, you have a kind of responsibility to society.
  </p><p>
    When you abuse your power and misuse your media platform to spread harmful propaganda,
    that is when a higher power needs to step in and intervene to stop you and hand just punishment.
    The chain of command is needed: if one level is disobedient and rebellious,
    people at the higher level need to step in, deliver punishment, and enforce the chain of command
    to keep society stable.
    Otherwise your society is a jungle, no rules, no regulations, ripe for exploitation by foreign hostile forces.
  </p><p>
    Without a high-level supervisor watching over all media, 
    society will ultimately collapse into muckracking and jingoism wars.
    It will be chaos.
    Everybody realizes that war leads to loss of lives.
    Then act responsible with the media, stop inciting conflict, 
    and stop colluding with external forces that seek to tear society asunder with color revolutions.
  </p>


  <h3>Knowledge capsules</h3>
  <p>From acts 1 and 2, according to Tariq, the Scarlet King was the rightful god of wisdom,
    but Rukkhadevata was a traitor who stole that title from him.
    And the Akademiya covered it up to frame the scarlet king.
    Tariq is also the guy who frauded us and got schooled by Alhaitham.
  </p><p>
    People can use Knowledge Capsules with their Akasha terminals to learn all sorts of information and skills.
    It is akin to Neo learning kung fu in the matrix.
  </p>


<h3>Cyno's quest</h3>
<p>Beating up Jhuba (朱巴) is good.
  Arresting and capturing Bahari is good.
  Naming your daughter Simin will not save Bahari though.
  Find the person who made that decision, dox their info to the public, and investigate them.
</p><p>
  If genshin storywriters are willing to write stories about Zhiyi (2.7 Yelan quest) and Seigou (2.6 event),
  then put Bahari, tighnari, zhongli, dori in jail.
  There are tons of stories of li being put in jail and punished,
  so there are tons of sources of inspiration for that,
  given that the storywriters seem to base a lot of their stories on reality
  mixed in with personal fantasies.
</p>


<h3>Mondstadt event</h3>
<p>The event introduces Mika.
  We also hear that Varka went on an expedition and met Capitano of the Harbingers.
</p><p>
  The event features a boar-killing game with the hunter Edmund.
</p><p>
  We also travel to Springvale (清泉镇), Qingce village,
  and meet someone named Quqing (曲清).
  Quqing gave some Yunlai tea to the traveler.
  This word 'Yunlai' is suspicious.
  If it is about advertising one of the descendants of the traitor Zhu Yuanzhang,
  then every last remaining descendant of Zhu Yuanzhang needs to be eliminated for treason.
</p>


<h2>Egyptian civilization and the desert</h2>
<p>The desert region looks beautifully designed as is the rest of Teyvat.
  The desert will feature actual sand, dunes, oasis, pyramids, mausoleums.
  If only the storywriters and people who make the videos and trailers were as conscientious as the environment designers.
</p><p>
  Dawei (大伟哥) and A'Tang (阿汤哥) said they wished to emphasize a couple of topics in the desert region:
  life versus death, mystery and technology.
  The lifelessness and death of the desert juxtaposes with the vibrant life and verdant lush of the rainforests in Sumeru.
</p><p>
  The desert region does have references to Egypt (埃及 Aiji) and the surrounding areas in the Sahara and West Asia.
  Egypt was one of the original cradles of civilization, located near the Nile river.
  It was the site of various technological developments too such as papyrus, writing, irrigation, bandaging (think mummies).
  This Egyptian civilization existed several thousand years before the rise of Islam and the Arabs.
</p><p>
  The Egyptian heiroglyphs are one of the earliest known writing systems (a pictographic system in some ways similar to Chinese).
  Over time, the heiroglyphs were replaced by other languages like Coptic and later the Arabic abjad (similar to Phoenician, Aramaic).
  Before the Arabs, there were periods of time when Latin and Greek were used (such as during the Roman empire).
  In fact, Cleopatra originates from this period. Cleopatra was born in Alexandria, Egypt (after Alexander the Great),
  and had a relationship with Caesar of Rome.
  Cleopatra married Ptolemy.
  Candace appears to have some design similarities to Cleopatra.
</p>

<h2>New region: the desert</h2>
<p>It is called the Great Red Sand (大赤沙海).</p>

<h2>New exploration mechanisms (September 20, 2022)</h2>
<p>The pyramids will bring new puzzles such as control mechanisms, primal embers, scones, beams, illusions, sandglass.
  These are supposedly technological creations left behind by King Deshret's civilization.
  The mirages of the deserts and the invisibility of the various puzzles and prisms in the ruins
  seem to deal a lot with the physics of optics.
</p>

<h2>New bosses and beasts</h2>
<p>
  There will be a new boss in the desert: Algorithm of Semi-Transient Matrix of Overseer Network.
  King Deshret the Scarlet King once built an advanced civilization in the desert.
  Perhaps the electro element is used to represent that connection to technology.
</p><p>
  The new boss and the triangular primal construct enemies can turn invisible.
  Using quicken reactions and electro attacks on them will make battling them easier.
  So these seem designed with Cyno and the new dendro element in mind (in particular the dendro-electro interaction).
  There are some other enemies that can go 'invisible' like the Fatui pyro agents.
</p><p>
  The Blightdragon will also be a new boss.
  This is to make 'li' the enemy.
  In Chinese the blightdragon is called 兆载永劫龙兽 (zhaozai yongjie longshou).
  This is good to make zhao, ayato, echoblast53 the enemy for treason, collusion with the USA, bias.
</p><p>
  The Chinese names for the Matrix boss and Blightdragon refer to 永恒 yongheng or eternity.
  The character 永 also appears in the name of the Yongle emperor (Ming), one of the most notorious emperors in history.
  So it is good that we get to beat up 永 yong.
</p>

<p>
  Scorpions, scarabs (圣金虫), quicksand unagi (流沙鳗鳗), vulptures, desert sumpter beasts and other creatures will also debut.
</p><p>
  There will also be desert date palms or 'Ajilenakh nuts'.
  There are also redcrest fruits that grow on cacti.
</p>


<h2>New weapons</h2>
<p>The desert region will introduce new weapons such as the Scarlet Sand polearm and Xiphos (西福斯) sword.
  Alhaitham and Nilou can be seen in various trailers wielding the Xiphos sword.
  So far, the Sumeru weapons put a lot of emphasis on EM, related to the theme of Dendro and Sumeru.
  The Xiphos blade is a type of Greek sword.
  This shows the blending of Egyptian, Greek (希腊), and Roman (罗马) cultures around the Mediterranean region.
</p>

<h2>Events</h2>
<p>There will be a Mondstadt event with Razor, another wolf electro character who will be powercrept by Cyno.
  The event will also center around killing boars (猪 zhu).
  You can also obtain a new polearm Missive Windspear from the event and the plume of changing winds.
</p><p>
  The Windchase event videoclip showed kazuha at slot #4, where he deserves to be, LAST.
  But still it would be better to remove kazuha and yoshinori completely from the game
  and kill every nori, tighnari, dori in the world for treason.
</p><p>
  Hyakunin Ikki will appear again.
  In 3.1, completing floor 4 of the spiral abyss will give a free Collei.
  Players can also obtain the Cloud Retainer bird device that follows you around.
</p><p>
  In a future version Genshin will also introduce a new game mode, the Genius Invocation TCG (a card game) that Cyno plays.
  Seeing Diluc beat up xingqiu with dawn in the card game is good.
</p>

<h2>The USA hegemon</h2>
<p>The USA controls and manipulates many sites on the Genshin fandom 
  to the point that English language media for the most part cannot be trusted.
  One example is a fandom site where multiple people meet together.
  This is what the USA wolf does:
  the FBI and CIA observe what kinds of users interact on the fandom site.
  They then attack and target the users they hate and force them out.
  This is the hypocrisy of USA democracy on social media sites.
  The FBI and CIA actively works to shut out voices they oppose,
  which effectively results in a censored web.
</p><p>
  But once they force that user out, they then accuse that user of decreased productivity
  and then use that as an exceuse to further benefit themselves and their proxies.
  The users that the FBI and CIA wants to keep online continue to interact on the social media site,
  and they continue to reap benefits.
  This starts a vicious cycle of oppressing the oppressed and enriching those who have the freedom on social media.
</p><p>
  This is one of the worst crimes the USA commits, and it even does it to its own citizens.
  As a result, aura himegimi, nori, echoblast53, little whole, tighnari, dori, zhongli, keqing, ayato, ayaka, kazuha
  must all be imprisoned along with their entire families, everybody close to them, and their descendants.
</p><p>
  As for this USA colony called Singapore, conquer and obliterate it.
  What you gain from destroying Singapore and purging their political and business elites
  outweights anything you can potentially lose.
  Lee Kuan Yew and Lee Hsien Loong are traitors and puppets of the USA empire 
  who would backstab their own people for their own selfish material benefit.
</p><p>
  The USA imperialists and their puppets must be purged entirely 
  just like how the House of Zhu was at Caishikou.
  Conquer Singapore, seige the city, blockade it from Malacca,
  or incite Malaysians to invade the city and overthrow their elites.
  Singapore never should have existed or seceded from Malaysia anyways.
  Once a British colony, it is now a USA colony, a continuation of the Anglo-American empire.
</p><p>
  A large-scale mass purge is needed.
  It needs to start by executing the traitors, shills, and agents that manipulate the USA fandom sites.
  Then punish the employees working within Genshin that colluded with the FBI and fandom users.
  Then punish the people who hired those employees for bringing idiots into your own company.
  Then punish everybody close to them and the people who work for other media organization that collude with them.
</p><p>
  If you care so much about the Ming, then in the 1300s, Zhu Yuanzhang, 
  the founder of the Ming dynasty genocided 100,000 people within his own country.
  China's population nowadays must be at least 10 times larger, so this means punishing and executing one million people.
  And if Zhu Yuanzhang could get away with it, what's stopping anybody from getting away with it nowadays.
  Rule through severe punishment.
  Execute nori, aura himegimi, and everybody close to them, up to one million people.
  If you think the Ming is all about suppressing one person or your enemies,
  then let's do a Ming dynasty on you and kill you off entirely.
</p><p>
  The USA puppets can learn a thing from Cyno's passive called 'the gift of silence'.
  It is better they shut up and never speak again.
  They need to be punished and learn from their mistakes just as Cyno said.
  The choice of Cyno's Chinese and Korean voice actors reflects the mistakes and sins that Li Hao committed.
</p><p>
  Have Cyno imprison tighnari, nori for treason and corruption.
  That would be a good and funny story.
</p><p>
  If the story can write about Seigou in 2.6,
  they write a story about Li Hao being sentenced to prison and punished.
</p>


<h2>Flaws in the Version 3.1 trailer and SP</h2>
<p>The scene with the Akademiya people stabbing and executing Katheryne is good.
  Now imprison nori, kazuha, yoshinori, dori, tighnari, zhongli, ayato next.
  </p>
  <p>Imprison Htein Lin. Imprison Li Yifeng.
    Imprison nori for corruption and collusion with the FBI.
    Conquer singapore and overthrow all the USA colonists and their proxies.
    Imprison everybody named nori, mori, dori in Japan.
    Pass a law banning people named zhu or chu from entering universities or government.
  </p>
  <p>The principle that if you like the character you like the voice actor is complete garbage.
  </p>
  <p>
    After having a whole version for tighnari, zhongli, ganyu,
    they still want to bring klee into 3.1.
    The USA water army are a bunch of rapists like li hao.
    They all need to be wiped out.
  </p><p>
    Lapdogs is pathetic acting like a USA colony and slave of Singapore.
  </p>

<p>
  There are still a number of huge flaws introduced by the 3.1 special program:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>remove Kazuha from the game and every special program, show a level 1 kazuha, level 1 tighnari, level 1 ayato in the Hyakunin Ikki like for the version 2.1 sp. Investigate the people making these videos.</li>
  <li>remove Ganyu from the credit card and bankrupt the bank that had such an idiotic idea. Get the SEC to investigate that company and accuse their board and c-suite of insider trading. Then send them to jail and confiscate their assets and net worth and redistribute it.</li>
  <li>remove Kazuha from the Cadillac endorsement. Cadillac and GM is a dying brand and fell off ever since the 2008 crash.</li>
  <li>remove Kazuha nori from the Genshin Concert picture and replace him with someone more likeable like Xiao.
  They're both anemo and they plunge, so Xiao can easily replace kazuha anywhere.</li>
  <li>remove zhongli, tighnari, dori, hunt down everyone close to them and imprison their entire families.</li>
  <li>remove xingqiu from the game and imprison everybody named zhu, qiu, chu.</li>
  <li>imprison tighnari, dori, kazuha, yoshinori, their entire families, and all their descendants so they go extinct.</li>
  <li>kazuha and klee already featured in 2.8. This overshilling of klee is an indication that the lee family needs to be punished. After all, Li Hao murdered and killed several people.</li>
  <li>remove ningguang, keqing, zhongli, tighnari from the Luminous Glimmers trailer. Replace those characters with Xiao, Shenhe, Yun Jin.</li>
  <li>remove tighnari and ayato from the ikki event. Then imprison nori and echoblast53 for colluding with the USA FBI. The USA attacks all its enemies and forces out anybody it does not like on media platforms. Thus do the same and kill every nori and echo that exists. These people can go fuck off to singapore or the USA. Then conquer singapore and purge all the USA puppets for treason.</li>
  <li>remove sayu from the special program and fire lilypichu. Kazuha and sayu are inferior for exploration due to their inferior genetics.
    Xiao and Yelan are much better for exploration and represent the true mobility meta.
  </li>
  <li>change the name of Aaru village as the name looks too similar to Aura. Aura Himegimi is a traitor and FBI agent who colluded with nori to attack people on the fandom. They all must be imprisoned for life along with everybody close to them.</li>
  <li>remove tighnari, dori, zhongli, ayaka from the congratulatory messages in the SP. They are persona non grata for the crimes and treason they committed. They are extremely unpopular and universally hated by all.</li>
  <li>remove dori from the demonstration with Candace. Censor that part of the video.</li>
  <li>do not explain the joke thing between Cyno and tighnari. Tighnari and nori are traitors that must be completely purged. Isolate them, make everybody hate them, keep attacking them and incite color revolutions to purge everybody close to nori.</li>
  <li>the rapists already brought up tighnari, do not mention lisa.</li>
  <li>criticize tighnari, zhongli, klee, dori. Say they are bad and stupid sheep.</li>
  <li>remove keqing, ayaka, xingqiu from the TCG art.</li>
  <li>imprison kazuha, sayu, dori, tighnari, zhongli, lisa, ganyu, ayato, ayaka for treason, collusion with the USA imperialists, falsifying info, abuse of power.</li>
  <li>delete titles like 智妙明论之林 and purge every ming sympathizer, their entire families, and everybody close to them for treason.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The USA is essentially saying: we would rather kill ourselves and put kazuha in the picture.
  If that's the case, then use kazuha to attack the USA.
  See who's laughing then.
  Dox their personal info and disagree with everything they say and imprison everybody close to them for treason and corruption.
</p><p>
  Another common strategy: let's give a little bit to you, but then give a lot to your enemy.
  It's win-win but we win twice.
</p><p>
  The collabs are proof that USA capitalists are using money to bribe, corrupt, 
  and manipulate global media to brainwash others.
  Citizens would be worried about foreign imperialists trying to colonize national media.
  They must be stopped.
</p><p>
  Another thing is to disagree with every single thing they say down to the last detail.
  Then attack their entire families and everybody close to them.
  Destroy their businesses, their allies, their patrons.
  Root them out and burn it all to the ground.
</p><p>
  Have the storywriters make everybody hate tighnari, zhongli, dori, kazuha, yoshinori, nara, ayato, ayaka, klee, ganyu
  and everybody love Xiao.
  Make tighnari the villain that gets imprisoned.
  Make everybody hate nori.
</p>

<p>List of characters to put at #4 slot: Tighnari, Dori, Kazuha, Zhongli, Klee, Ayato, Ayaka, Ganyu.
  The number four 四 si sounds like death 死 si in Chinese (and Japanese).
  So superstitious people beware the number four.
  Or place them last to indicate that the USA, Singapore, and their proxies get the lowest priority.
