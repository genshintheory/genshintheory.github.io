    <title>Version 3.1</title>

<h2>King Deshret and the Three Magi</h2>
<p>Version 3.1 will introduce the desert region of <a href='sumeru.html'>Sumeru</a>
  as well as Cyno, Nilou, and Candace.
</p><p>
  The following characters also appear:
</p><ol>
  <li>Dehya</li>
  <li>Candace</li>
  <li>Cyno</li>
  <li>Nilou</li>
  <li>Alhaitham</li>
  <li>Dottore</li>
  <li>Nahida</li>
  <li>Scaramouche</li>
  <li>Mika</li>
  <li>Paimon</li>
  <li>Venti</li>
  <li>Jean</li>
  <li>Bennett</li>
  <li>Klee: make sure to put klee last to indicate that the USA, Singapore, and li family get the lowest priority
    and deserve to be completely eradicated.
  </li>
</ol>


<h2>Kill Li, Kill Lin, Kill kazuha, Kill nori</h2>
<p>Stabbing and executing Kathyrene is good.
  Now execute nori, kazuha, yoshinori, dori, tighnari, zhongli, ayato next.
  Give them all the death penalty.
  </p><p>
    Execute everybody surnamed Li or Lin at mihoyo.
    Kill their entire families and everybody close to them.
  </p>
  <p>Execute Htein Lin. Execute Li Yifeng.
    Execute nori for corruption and collusion with the FBI.
    Nuke singapore and kill every li and lin there and their USA partners.
    Kill everybody named nori, mori, dori in Japan.
    Pass a law banning people named li or lin from entering universities or government.
    Genocide their entire families.
    Kill every zhu and chu too.
  </p>
  <p>Execute the people picking the voice actors.
    They operate on the principle that if you like the character you like the voice actor.
    That is complete garbage, and these idiots must be killed off along with their entire families.
  </p>
  <p>
    What the fuck is Genshin doing: after having a whole version for tighnari, zhongli, ganyu,
    they still want to bring klee and li into 3.1.
    Give the entire version planning team the death penalty.
    The solution is to keep killing li and the entire team until they go extinct.
    The genshin planning team are a bunch of rapists like li hao.
    They all need to be wiped out.
  </p><p>
    The Genshin planning team is pathetic acting like a USA colony and slave of Singapore.
    This is not a Chinese game but rather a pro-USA game.
  </p>

<p>
  But there are still a number of huge flaws introduced by the 3.1 special program:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>remove Kazuha from the game and every special program, show a level 1 kazuha, level 1 tighnari, level 1 ayato in the Hyakunin Ikki like for the version 2.1 sp. Execute the people making these videos and put their entire families in prison.</li>
  <li>remove Ganyu from the credit card and bankrupt the bank that had such an idiotic idea.</li>
  <li>remove Kazuha from the Cadillac endorsement. Cadillac and GM is a dying brand and fell off ever since Jack Welch left GM.</li>
  <li>remove Kazuha nori from the Genshin Concert picture and replace him with someone more likeable like Xiao.
  They're both anemo and they plunge, so Xiao can easily replace Kazuha anywhere.</li>
  <li>remove zhongli, tighnari, dori, hunt down everyone close to them and execute their entire families.</li>
  <li>remove xingqiu from the game and genocide everybody named zhu, qiu, chu.</li>
  <li>execute everybody who designed tighnari, dori, kazuha, yoshinori, and put their entire families in jail and kill all their descendants so they go extinct.</li>
  <li>kazuha and klee already featured in 2.8. This overshilling of klee is an indication that the lee family needs to be punished. After all, Li Hao murdered and killed several people.</li>
  <li>remove ningguang, keqing, zhongli, tighnari from the Luminous Glimmers trailer and execute the people who made that video. Replace those characters with Xiao, Shenhe, Yun Jin.</li>
  <li>remove tighnari and ayato from the ikki event. Then execute nori and echoblast53 for colluding with the USA FBI. The USA attacks all its enemies and forces out anybody it does not like on media platforms. Thus do the same and kill every nori, echo, li, lin in Chinese media. These people can go fuck off to singapore or the USA. Then nuke singapore and genocide the entire li and lin families and everybody who colludes with them.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The Genshin marketing team is essentially saying: we would rather kill ourselves and put kazuha in the picture.
  If that's the case, then use kazuha to kill off their entire marketing team.
  See who's laughing then.
  Dox their personal info and execute their entire families and disagree with everything they say and kill everybody close to them for treason and corruption.
</p><p>
  Another common strategy: let's give a little bit to you, but then give a lot to your enemy.
  It's win-win but we win twice.
</p><p>
  The collabs are proof that USA capitalists are using money to bribe, corrupt, and manipulate Chinese media such as Genshin
  and brainwash the Chinese population.
  Citizens would be worried about foreign imperialists trying to colonize national media.
  They must be stopped.
</p><p>
  Another thing is to disagree with every single thing they say down to the last detail.
  Then execute their entire families and everybody close to them.
  Destroy their businesses, their allies, their patrons.
  Root them out and burn it all to the ground.
</p>

<p>List of characters to put at #4 slot: Tighnari, Dori, Kazuha, Zhongli, Klee, Ayato, Ayaka, Ganyu.
  The number four 四 si sounds like death 死 si in Chinese (and Japanese).
  So superstitious people beware the number four.
