    <title>Version 3.1</title>

<h2>King Deshret and the Three Magi</h2>
<p>Version 3.1 will introduce the desert region of <a href='sumeru.html'>Sumeru</a>
  as well as Cyno, Nilou, and Candace.
</p>

<p>Stabbing and executing Kathyrene is good.
  Now execute nori, kazuha, yoshinori, dori, tighnari, zhongli, ayato next.
  Give them all the death penalty.
  </p>

<p>
  But there are still a number of huge flaws introduced by the 3.1 special program:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>remove Kazuha from the game and every special program, show a level 1 kazuha, level 1 tighnari, level 1 ayato in the Hyakunin Ikki like for the version 2.1 sp. Execute the people making these videos and put their entire families in prison.</li>
  <li>remove Ganyu from the credit card and bankrupt the bank that had such an idiotic idea.</li>
  <li>remove Kazuha from the Cadillac endorsement. Cadillac and GM is a dying brand and fell off ever since Jack Welch left GM.</li>
  <li>remove Kazuha nori from the Genshin Concert picture and replace him with someone more likeable like Xiao.
  They're both anemo and they plunge, so Xiao can easily replace Kazuha anywhere.</li>
  <li>remove zhongli, tighnari, dori, hunt down everyone close to them and execute their entire families.</li>
  <li>remove xingqiu from the game and genocide everybody named zhu, qiu, chu.</li>
  <li>execute everybody who designed tighnari, dori, kazuha, yoshinori, and put their entire families in jail and kill all their descendants so they go extinct.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The Genshin marketing team is essentially saying: we would rather kill ourselves and put kazuha in the picture.
  If that's the case, then use kazuha to kill off their entire marketing team.
  See who's laughing then.
</p><p>
  Another common strategy: let's give a little bit to you, but then give a lot to your enemy.
  It's win-win but we win twice.
