<h2>Artifact Tierlist</h2>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Tier
</th>
<th>Artifact set (mostly 5 stars)
</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>SS
</td>
<td>Emblem, VV, Crimson Witch, Heart of Depth, 
  Shimenawa (2p is good, 4p is more niche but can be bis in certain scenarios, gives large dmg bonus)
  Vermillion (2p is good, 4p while niche gives largest ATK buff among artifacts),
  Gilded (4p can give most EM in game among artifact sets: 230 EM)
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>S
</td>
<td>Noblesse (got powercrept by Emblem for most characters),
  Husk, Clam, Wanderer's Troupe (not many use this), 
  Gladiator's (2p is good, 4p only for NA and melee)
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>A
</td>
<td>Thundering Fury (2p), Archaic Petra (2p), Pale Flame, Bloodstained, Tenacity (few people use this),
  Berserker (early game it is useful for getting crit),
  EO (2p good, 4p for NA, depreciated by Gladiator/Shimenawa)
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>B
</td>
<td>Thundersoother, Pyro RES artifact, 
  Retracing Bolide (you would almost never use these except in niche situations),
  Maiden's Beloved (nowadays you would use clam set, noblesse, or some other set)
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>F (worst in game)
</td>
<td>Blizzard (many enemies cannot be frozen, buff is underwhelming),
  Deepwood (underwhelming, 30% less than VV 40%, only shreds one element whereas VV can shred 4,
  they really held back this set)
</td></tr>

<h2>Artifact Domain Ranking</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Emblem domain (tie for first): both emblem and shimenawa (2 piece) sets can be used on various characters. Emblem is bis for many, 
  and 2 piece shimenawa (givint 18% ATK) can also be used on various dps characters such as Xiao, Yae, etc.
  The 2p shimenawa is essentially farmable gladiators.
</li>
<li>Chasm domain (tie for first): both 2p sets of Vermillion and EO give ATK, making them universal on most characters in the game.
  The 2p-2p combo works well on most characters too.
</li>
<li>Viridescent Venerer: vv gives 40% res shred, which is a big buff to damage, 
making it one of the most important sets for anemo supports, which many teams need.
Even though maiden's is the other set in this domain, the damage increase from the anemo res shred basically offsets this.
</li>
<li>Dragonspine domain: both sets are pretty good. The blizzard strayer is the bis for freeze cryo units. 
The hydro set 2p is also pretty good, and the 4p is bis for Childe.
However, many other hydro units have different bis (like emblem or clam).
</li>
  <li>Husk/clam domain: both sets are very niche for specific units in the game that not everybody may use.
    But husk is bis for those specific units (Albedo, Itto, etc). 
    And the clam set is a nice idea for converting healing into damage.
  </li>
  <li>Crimson domain: crimson witch is still valuable for pyro dps in absence of other pyro artifacts.
  But the pyro res artifact on the other hand is underwhelming.
</li>
  <li>Noblesse domain: Noblesse is good, but took a hit since Emblem was released in 2.0. 
    Noblesse is still valuable but not to the extent that it was before version 2.0.
    Bloodstained can be easily replaced by Pale Flame.
  </li>
  <li>Tenacity/Pale Flame domain: both sets are very niche for specific units in the game.
    Even for those units, they can basically be replaced.
    With more HP scaling units though, the value of this domain can rise.
  </li>
</ol>
