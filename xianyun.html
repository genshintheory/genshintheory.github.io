  <figcaption>^ Is this... fanservice? Genshin needs more art/fanservice of mature characters like this.
    As Liuyun is also a bird (鸟), perhaps another name for her could be Liuniao (遛鸟).
    Art like this would surely make a lot of people want to Liuniao for her...

  <p>Xianyun, also known as Liuyun (Cloud Retainer), Bayonetta, 
    is an ancient northern nomadic tribe that invaded the Zhou dynasty (猃狁).
    They are the predecessors of the Xiongnu, which was incorporated into the Han dynasty when it was on a 吞食小国 spree.
  </p><p>
    Her title is 鸾音鹤信 Luanyin Hexin.
    Luan is one of the names of the Xiongnu rulers (namely the Luandi clan).
  </p>
  <p>
    We need more historical fanservice like this.
  </p><p>
    The genetics of northern and western Chinese is quite mixed because of all the nomadic migrations in history.
  </p>

  <p>So what does Xianyun, Liuyun, and the Han dynasty have anything to do with the theme of Fontaine, the British, and Queen Alexandrina?
    There is actually a special connection between the Han and Alexandrina.
    We may talk about this elsewhere, but people may already be able to guess this.
  </p><p>
    There is also a place called Qiaoying village in Chenyu vale, which released in 4.4 alongside Xianyun.

  <h2>Kit</h2>

  <h3>Elemental Skill: Chasing Crane</h3>
  <p>
    Her E makes her jump into the air and enter the 'Cloud Transmogrification' state. 
    It can be used 3 times and converts her plunging atk damage to driftcloud wave/chasing crane (this is leveled with her E).
    The more times the E is used the more her plunge does.
    For her 3rd level plunge she turns into a cran and can home in on targets.
    Even if she is on ground after her 3rd E there will be a short window of time where she can still plunge.
    <!-- sort of like lunae but crude version -->
    Her E is also called skyladder (the part when she jumps in the air).
    The skyladder will deal anemo damage to enemies she hits while ascending (at most once per enemy).
    During her cloud state, she will not take fall damage.
  </p>
  <p>E can be used midair.
    So this is an upgrade of kazuha.
    But besides that Liuniao is now part of a special group of characters that can use their skills midair:
    Xiao, Kazuha, Xianyun.
  </p><p>
    Note the first E cannot be used midair, only the 2nd and 3rd can so it is not exactly like Xiao or Kazuha.
    For example, while gliding XY may not be able to use E 
    (unless she already used the first E on ground, so you can do E on ground, glide, use E again).
    Besides vertical leap, it also has decent horizontal traversal, so a bit of a mix between Xiao and Kazuha E.
  </p><p>
    The E generates 5 anemo particles.
    It has 12s cd.
    If she does not plunge during her cloud state, the cd will be decreased by 3s.
    So if exploring it is recommended not to plunge all the time while using triple E.
  </p>

  <h3>Elemental Burst: Stars Gather at Dusk</h3>
  <p>
    Her Q has 70 energy cost and 16s duration and brings Xiao to the masses,
    just like how the silicon chip brought computing to the masses
    and Feynman diagrams brought quantum field theory to the masses.
  </p><p>
    Technically, Albedo's E already brings Xiao to the masses (since 1.2)
    so here Albedo and Xianyun share something in common.
  </p>
  <p>
    Her Q increases the party's jump height as long as starwicker has stacks.
    Each time they plunge, it will consume 1 starwicker stack and do a coordinated aoe anemo damage.
    The Q starts with 8 starwicker stacks.
    Her starwicker is the newest creation from the Lunastar Artificer series.
  </p><p>
    The Q also does healing over time.
    The healing is less than Jean's.
    But Xianyun is less so a healer and more so a plunge buffer.
    Her passive buffs plunges based on her atk, up to 8 plunges.
    And this buff only affects 1 enemy.
    So for st situations this is fine and is arguably exactly what Xiao needs C0-C6.
    In aoe, well...
  </p><p>
    While starwicker is active, one of her passives buffs party plunge dmg based on her atk.
    The plunge will only do buffed damage to one opponent, making this st.
    (This does not snapshot.)
  </p>

  <p>
    She has another passive that buffs plunge crit rate for each (unique?) enemy hit by her E plunge, 
    up to 4 stacks, for a max of 10% crit rate.
    The stacks give 4/6/8/10% cr.
    Apparently in st, hitting the same enemy will not give more stacks.
    So in st, she gives 4% crit rate.
  </p><p>
    Apparently in beta this passive used to create a vacuum.
    Arguably, for big st bosses, a vacuum may not help as much as 4% crit rate.
    But if it were say:
    40/60/80/100% crit rate,
    oh boi that would be a different story.
    Xiao can get 33% crit rate from Marechaussee from his own hp drain, and that is not even his bis.
    It would have been nice to see Liuyun give more crit rate than Marechaussee.
  </p>

  <p>Like how Chongyun enable cryo infusion dps via his E,
    Liuyun enables plunging dps via her Q.
  </p>


  <h3>Constellations</h3>
  <p>C1 gives extra charge on E. This is for energy and exploration.</p>
  <p>C2 (Aloof From the World): increase plunge by extra 400% of atk, up to 18000 additive damage.
    18k/3k=600% more scaling.
    It also increases atk by 20% for 15s after using E skyladder.
    Like her passive, this is st.
    So it can be said Xianyun complements Xiao for st situations.
    In aoe situations, C6 Xiao can handle himself.
  </p>
  <p>C4 makes her heal the team when her E plunge hits an opponent.
    So it is not quite a baizhu replacement (baizhu E heals even without hitting an opponent).
    This monopoly will need to be broken sooner or later.
  </p>
  <p>C6 turns her into C0 Xiao and gives 70% crit dmg on lv3 E plunge (can use 8 times within 16s after Q).
    It is just that her Q will not drain hp or give 100% dmg bonus.
  </p><p>
    Can the E generate energy in Q?
    If so she can generate 8*5=40 particles for herself during her Q.
    If each particle gives 3 energy, she can easily battery her own Q with no ER at all (100% ER).
  </p>


  <h2>Build</h2>
  <p>ER-ATK-ATK, full ATK or 2 ATK + ER.
    4p vv for autumn dps.
    For Xiao or other builds:
    4p songs day past (xishi set), even 4p verm (with Focalors),
    2p-2p glad/shime/verm/echo offering/woods,
    2p emblem/noblesse (for ER) + 2p atk,
    2p-2p ER,
    4p noblesse, 4p clam.
  </p>
  <p>
    For weapons, her signature giving 700+ atk is fine for the energy passive.
    Otherwise, ER weapon, favonius, even sac frag, ttds, can work.
    And the 2.5 weapon Oathsworn is one of her best 4* options.
    Prototype Amber could work too.
  </p>
  <p>
    Build her more like buffer than healer.
    In most of her (better) teams, she will also have Bennett on the team.
    If you want an anemo healer just for Furina stacks, Jean exists.
  </p>

  <p>She can be a dps at C0 for st.
    This becomes more viable at C6 though.
    She could then be built 4p desert pavilion or even 4p vermillion (if with someone like Focalors) on ATK-Anemo-Crit build.
    She can also use dps weapons like kagura (kv), solar pearl, aeon wave, tulaytullah, cashflow, etc.
  </p><p>
    She can buff her own plunge dmg (her NA scaling) but she will be mostly st.
    The high plunge from her NA talent has 281% scaling at lv10,
    which is lower than the plunge from her lv3 E which is 608% scaling at lv10 (these are the aoe parts of her plunge).
    Her buff increases plunge damage by 200% of her atk (this is st).
    So C6 allows her to use her higher-scaling E plunges instead of her NA plunges.
  </p>


  <h2>Teams</h2>
  <p>Her Xiao teams will look like:
    Xiao-Bennett-Xianyun-flex.
    The flex could be Faruzan, Jean C4, Furina, etc.
    It could even be Chongyun for his cryo infusion.
  </p>
  <p>Her Q can support Cyno for vv shred (16s of anemo app).
    For example: Cyno Nahida Xianyun Focalors.
    Would plunge E spam Cyno be his best combo? This is pending calcs.
    But we recall a 3.1 Mond event that enabled plunging.
    For other electro, Yae, Raiden can work.
    Some say Raiden plunge may have good dps compared to her NA/CA combos.
  </p>
  <p>
    For pyro, she can support Diluc dragonstrike and Gaming.
    A team could look like: Diluc-Focalors-XY-Bennett.
    Pyro plungers can vape their hits (even melt), which can lead to some big numbers,
    especially for Diluc as he has the highest plunge multiplier in the game.
    As for his daughter, she can do N2C + plunge (basically CA + plunge) with XY,
    and this may outdps her C1 if she can vape all her plunges.
    So this sort of shows how good her C1 is.
    However, due to her passive, she has anti-synergy with healers, unlike Xiao and the Fontaine characters (Lyney, Noctis, or Furina).
  </p><p>
    Dragonstrike Dehya is possible with C6 Bennett infusion.
    And this will probably be one of Dehya's higher dps teams.
    Indeed with C6 Bennett infusion any melee character can becometh pyro Xiao.
    Some have even suggested Bennett dps
    where he is the plunge dps and interweaves E in between plunges (so C6 Bennett becometh approximation of C6 Xiao like Cyno).
  </p>
  <p>Would Eula dragonstrike work?
    It could, something like Eula-Mika/Bennett-XY-Raiden.
    But Eula likes to NA to build stacks faster on her nuke.
  </p>
  <p>Alhaitham or Nahida are possible but they prefer hyperbloom.
    For geo, perhaps Itto or Noelle could work with Liuyun.
    Some have even said Yun Jin with Bennett C6 infusion, Furina, XY can be good enough to 36* abyss.
    We have not done this calculation ourselves to verify this, but it seems plausible given the high scalings on plunges.
  </p>
  <p>
    For cryo, Wrio, Ayaka are possible.
    With Chongyun infusion, any melee can be cryo Xiao.
    With Candace infusion, one can get hydro Xiao.
  </p>
  

  <p>Xiao has the highest polearm plunge scaling.
    Diluc has the highest plunge scaling in the game.
    Razor is 2nd among claymores, followed by Itto.
    Kazuha has the highest sword plunge scaling.
    Catalysts generally have similar plunge scalings (which are a bit lower than melee characters).
    Among bows, Childe interestingly has the highest plunge scales (this is bruhmogus).
    But generally speaking, XY may suit melee dps more than the bows unless you want to do physical bow plunge dps for the dank memes and giggles.
  </p><p>
    And Xiao Itto Kazuha have the same plunge scalings.
  </p>

  <p>Animation canceling:
    claymores have certain advantages in plunging:
    1) they can dash cancel and plunge quite frequently,
    2) they have larger hitboxes so they can proc collision plunge dmg more easily (note this collision dmg apparently cannot vape or proc reactions).
    As such Diluc has some advantages as a plunge dragonstrike dps (besides his high scalings).
  </p>

  <p>Which characters synergize the most with XY?
    XY Q enables any character to plunge, but there are some characters that can get more out of this gimmick.
    As stated above, claymores with their larger hitboxes can synergize more.
    And claymores with the highest plunge scalings, including Diluc, Itto, etc. can do more damage.
    The fact that Diluc can vape his plunges multiplies his dragonstrike dps even more.
    Gaming also has synergy as his kit is centered around plunges.
    Even physical Eula or Razor can leverage plunging for higher multipliers (though it is believed that Diluc, Gaming tend to have a bit more synergy with XY vv).
    Chongyun can have interesting interactions with XY via the cryo field infusion for some melt plunge combos.
  </p><p>
    Among polearms, Xiao has the most synergy as he specifically gets 100% dmg bonus on plunges, and XY complements him in ST situations.
    Besides Xiao, Cyno probably needs XY the most of any anemo support for vv because her Q lasts 16s (to accomodate Cyno's long burst).
    As of 4.4, besides Kazuha, not too many sword users give much buff to plunging specifically.
    Bennett C6 is the other sword user that can pair with XY for pyro infusion plunges for vapes/melts.
    Bows and catalysts do not particularly have any special synergy with plunging either.
  </p><p>
    In all, XY's best or most common teammates will probably be Xiao, Bennett, Diluc, Gaming.
  </p><p>
    Also Furina might be needed for vapes as plunging does not proc Yelan/XQ.
    It is why Furina works well with Xiao.
  </p>


  <h2>Xiao</h2>
  <p>
    For c0-c5 Xiao, Xianyun gives pretty substantial buff to plunge dps (makes his plunge do a bigger nuke of damage).
    For c6 Xiao (E spam), Faruzan is needed for buffing E as that becomes most of his dps.
    But for st, Xianyun still gives a substantial buff.
  </p>

  <p>
    Xianyun gives 200% of atk as additional plunge damage.
    So if Xiao plunge scaling is around 400%, it now becomes 600% (assuming they have same atk).
    Her buff is effectively additional scaling (like Albedo's Cinnabar sword 辰砂之纺锤).
    This is a 1.5 times buff, assuming that Xiao and Xianyun have same atk.
    That is, we assume Xiao has Bennett for 3k atk, and since Xianyun is off-field we assume she has 3k atk without Bennett.
  </p><p>
    Her buff can increase if she has more atk.
    If she caps the buff with ~5k atk for 9000 additive dmg, the effective scaling is 
    <!-- 8500/3000=283.3%. -->
    <!-- 8500 got increased to 9000 -->
    9000/3000=300%.
    And this becomes nearly a 1.75 times increase in damage, which is very good for Xiao.
    Some have said it can be hard to reach ~5k atk with Xianyun even with triple ATK artifacts unless one has really good artifacts or her signature.
    For the purposes of our calculations, we assume she caps her buff (she would need at least 4500 atk).
  </p><p>
    Subdps versus harmony buffer:
    There is a difference between Xianyun doing off-field 200% atk coordinated per plunge
    and buffing Xiao's plunges by 200% atk.
    If she is a subdps her own dmg bonus is factored into the 200% atk.
    But since she is buffing Xiao, Xiao's dmg bonus is multiplied to the 200% atk.
  </p>
  <p>
    And this matters as Xiao gets 100% dmg bonus on plunges with his Q.
    This is also what separates Xiao from other dps.
    Xianyun enables anybody to plunge, but very few dps will be able to reach as much dmg bonus as Xiao for plunges.
  </p>

  <!-- redo Xiao dps with Xianyun buff, which is non-negligible -->

  <h2>Calculations</h2>
  <h3>C0</h3>
  <p>Assume 4p desert, anemo goblet for 40+61.6=101.6% dmg bonus after E use.
    We assume 3k atk with Bennett (so she may not cap her own buff if on dps build).
    During Q, her NA plunge has 281+200=481% atk scaling (to st).
    She can use 8 plunges in 18s (Q cd).
    The st dps is
    $$x_0 = 8*2.016*481/18 = 430.976$$
    This is single target and is not bad for a harmony support.
    But in aoe situations, the dps will decrease.
    $$x_0 = 8*2.016*281/18 = 251.776$$
  </p>
  <p>
    How much does she buff Xiao?
    What is Xiao's dps with Xianyun?
    Suppose Xianyun is built as a support and her buff is capped:
    so her passive gives 300% effective scaling.
    C0 Xiao's dps (10 plunges) is then
    <!-- $$a_0 = 10*(1.466+1)*(400+300)/18 = 959$$ -->
    $$a_0 = 10*(1.466+.952)*(404+300)/18 = 945.7$$
    This is without midair/pierce damage (or his dmg bonus passives).
    Also this is st.
    It is an increase of around 1.7 times as stated above.
    The added mv from her passive (for Xiao) is
    $$a_x = 10*(1.466+.952)*300/18 = 403$$
  </p>
