  <p>Xianyun, also known as Liuyun (Cloud Retainer), Bayonetta, 
    is an ancient northern nomadic tribe that invaded the Zhou dynasty (猃狁).
    They are the predecessors of the Xiongnu, which was incorporated into the Han dynasty when it was on a 吞食小国 spree.
  </p><p>
    We need more historical fanservice like this.
  </p><p>
    The genetics of northern and western Chinese is quite mixed because of all the nomadic migrations in history.
  </p>

  <p>So what does Xianyun, Liuyun, and the Han dynasty have anything to do with the theme of Fontaine, the British, and Queen Alexandrina?
    There is actually a special connection between the Han and Alexandrina.
    We may talk about this elsewhere, but people may already be able to guess this.
  </p><p>
    There is also a place called Qiaoying village in Chenyu vale, which released in 4.4 alongside Xianyun.

  <h2>Kit</h2>

  <h2>Elemental Skill: Chasing Crane</h2>
  <p>
    Her E makes her jump into the air and enter the 'Cloud Transmogrification' state. 
    It can be used 3 times and converts her plunging atk damage to driftcloud wave/chasing crane (this is leveled with her E).
    The more times the E is used the more her plunge does.
    <!-- sort of like lunae -->
    Her E is also called skyladder (the part when she jumps in the air).
    The skyladder will deal anemo damage to enemies she hits while ascending (at most once per enemy).
    During her cloud state, she will not take fall damage.
  </p>
  <p>E can be used midair.
    So this is an upgrade of kazuha.
  </p><p>
    The E generates 5 anemo particles.
    <!-- verify -->
    It has 12s cd.
    If she does not plunge during her cloud state, her the cd of her next E will be decreased by 3.
