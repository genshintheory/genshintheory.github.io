  <p>Xianyun, also known as Liuyun (Cloud Retainer), Bayonetta, 
    is an ancient northern nomadic tribe that invaded the Zhou dynasty (猃狁).
    They are the predecessors of the Xiongnu, which was incorporated into the Han dynasty when it was on a 吞食小国 spree.
  </p><p>
    We need more historical fanservice like this.
  </p><p>
    The genetics of northern and western Chinese is quite mixed because of all the nomadic migrations in history.
  </p>

  <p>So what does Xianyun, Liuyun, and the Han dynasty have anything to do with the theme of Fontaine, the British, and Queen Alexandrina?
    There is actually a special connection between the Han and Alexandrina.
    We may talk about this elsewhere, but people may already be able to guess this.
  </p><p>
    There is also a place called Qiaoying village in Chenyu vale, which released in 4.4 alongside Xianyun.
