  <p>Xianyun, also known as Liuyun (Cloud Retainer), Bayonetta, 
    is an ancient northern nomadic tribe that invaded the Zhou dynasty (猃狁).
    They are the predecessors of the Xiongnu, which was incorporated into the Han dynasty when it was on a 吞食小国 spree.
  </p><p>
    We need more historical fanservice like this.
  </p><p>
    The genetics of northern and western Chinese is quite mixed because of all the nomadic migrations in history.
  </p>

  <p>So what does Xianyun, Liuyun, and the Han dynasty have anything to do with the theme of Fontaine, the British, and Queen Alexandrina?
    There is actually a special connection between the Han and Alexandrina.
    We may talk about this elsewhere, but people may already be able to guess this.
  </p><p>
    There is also a place called Qiaoying village in Chenyu vale, which released in 4.4 alongside Xianyun.

  <h2>Kit</h2>

  <h2>Elemental Skill: Chasing Crane</h2>
  <p>
    Her E makes her jump into the air and enter the 'Cloud Transmogrification' state. 
    It can be used 3 times and converts her plunging atk damage to driftcloud wave/chasing crane (this is leveled with her E).
    The more times the E is used the more her plunge does.
    <!-- sort of like lunae -->
    Her E is also called skyladder (the part when she jumps in the air).
    The skyladder will deal anemo damage to enemies she hits while ascending (at most once per enemy).
    During her cloud state, she will not take fall damage.
  </p>
  <p>E can be used midair.
    So this is an upgrade of kazuha.
  </p><p>
    The E generates 5 anemo particles.
    <!-- verify -->
    It has 12s cd.
    If she does not plunge during her cloud state, her the cd of her next E will be decreased by 3.
  </p>

  <h2>Elemental Burst: Stars Gather at Dusk</h2>
  <p>
    Her Q has 70 energy cost and 16s duration and brings Xiao to the masses,
    just like how the silicon chip brought computing to the masses
    and Feynman diagrams brought quantum field theory to the masses.
  </p><p>
    Technically, Albedo's E already brings Xiao to the masses (since 1.2)
    so here Albedo and Xianyun share something in common.
  </p>
  <p>
    Her Q increases the party's jump height as long as starwicker has stacks.
    Each time they plunge, it will consume 1 starwicker stack and do a coordinated aoe anemo damage.
    The Q starts with 8 starwicker stacks.
    Her starwicker is the newest creation from the Lunastar Artificer series.
  </p><p>
    The Q also does healing over time.
    The healing is less than Jean's.
    But Xianyun is less so a healer and more so a plunge buffer.
    Her passive buffs plunges based on her atk, up to 8 plunges.
    And this buff only affects 1 enemy.
    So for st situations this is fine and is arguably exactly what Xiao needs C0-C6.
    In aoe, well...
  </p><p>
    While starwicker is active, one of her passives buffs party plunge dmg based on her atk.
    The plunge will only do buffed damage to one opponent, making this st.
    (This does not snapshot.)
  </p>

  <p>
    She has another passive that buffs plunge crit rate for each (unique?) enemy hit by her E plunge, 
    up to 4 stacks, for a max of 10% crit rate.
    The stacks give 4/6/8/10% cr.
    Apparently in st, hitting the same enemy will not give more stacks.
    So in st, she gives 4% crit rate.
  </p><p>
    Apparently in beta this passive used to create a vacuum.
    Arguably, for big st bosses, a vacuum may not help as much as 4% crit rate.
    But if it were say:
    40/60/80/100% crit rate,
    oh boi that would be a different story.
    Xiao can get 33% crit rate from Marechaussee from his own hp drain, and that is not even his bis.
    It would have been nice to see Liuyun give more crit rate than Marechaussee.
  </p>

  <p>Like how Chongyun enable cryo infusion dps via his E,
    Liuyun enables plunging dps via her Q.
