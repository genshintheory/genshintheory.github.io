  <h2>The path of destruction</h2>
  <p>The Destruction is the name of a path in <a href='star-rail'>Star Rail</a>,
    referring to characters with great survivability and that make sacrifices to increase their damage.
    Genshin also has such characters: Xiao being a famous example, sacrificing his hp to increase his damage.
    Itto, Dehya, Kuki, hu tao are other examples of 'destruction' characters that sacrifice a stat to boost something else.
  </p><p>
    It seems the hydro MC also has an hp sacrifice mechanism via their E.
    So does this mean more Fontaine characters, maybe even Focalors can do something similar?
    Then Fontaine could just be Xiao land, the nation of the destruction dao.
    It could make sense: as hydro resonance boosts hp, if you have excess hp, you got to put it to some use, 
    like perhaps sacrifice some to boost atk or dmg bonus.
  </p><p>
    Star Rail gives various ideas for what destruction type characters can do:
    some can sacrifice team hp to boost their own atk.
    See Blade, Svarog, Jingliu.

  <h2>Constellations</h2>
  <p>C1 is garbage, containing the names of two people who got fired. 
    C2 is better than C1.
    C4 is also better than C1, also one of the best quests in Genshin.
    C6 is good.
  </p>


  <h2>Build</h2>
  <p>Heart of Depth 4p, Marechausse 4p, Nymph Dream 4p, Vourukasha 4p can all work.</p>
  <p>The real question is what kind of team would HMC be used in?
    Perhaps their role is that of subdps in say Nilou teams.
    But even there, Barbara may be more preferable.
