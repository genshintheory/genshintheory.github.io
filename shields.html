  <h2>1 Character shields</h2>
  <p>
    Character shields have HP, indicating how much damage they absorb.
    $$H = \text{Base}\times\text{Absorption bonuses}\times\text{Elemental bonus}\times(1+\text{Shield Strength})$$
    The base is determined by the specific talent (or whether it is a crystallize shield).
    Absorption bonuses include those from talents, passives, and constellations and can sometimes be multiplicative.
    Elemental bonuses refer to how a shield absorbs its own element more effectively, with Geo shields absorbing everything effectively.
    Shield Strength is a character attribute that can be increased via talents, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, Morax's shield at level 10 has base
    $$\text{Base} = 2712 + .2304(\text{Max HP})$$
    It has 150% dmg absorption against everything.
    With one of his passives, the shield can fortify up to 5 times, each time granting 5% more shield strength.
    So suppose we have 25% shield strength (ignoring any other shield buffs from things like 4p tenacity).
    Then the amount of damage the jade shield can absorb is
    $$H = (2712 + .2304(\text{Max HP}))(1.5)(1+.25)
    = 5085 + 0.432(\text{Max HP})$$
    So if Morax has 30k HP (very achievable), the shield can absorb 18045 damage.
    Basically the things in the game that can destroy this shield are Childe's attacks or a Maguu Kenki's attacks.
    Then of course there are things like corrosion that bleed through the shield.
  </p>

  <h2>2 Enemy Shields</h2>
  <p>
    There are various types of enemy shields.
    Enemy shields can take up to 3 types of damage that are additive: elemental gauge damage, poise damage, and regular damage.
  </p><p>
    Usually Geo and Frozen shields take poise damage (heavy attacks like Claymore, Plunging, Geo, explosions).
    Environmental objects such as ore have a poise hp, whereas things like grass and hay also have a dendro 'shield' (before burning).
    Some other shields/armor do not take any damage from regular attacks and need elemental gauge damage (reactions) to break.
  </p><p>
    There are scale factors that convert poise damage and regular damage into shield damage.
  </p>

  <h3>Reaction damage</h3>
  <p>
    We first discuss gauge shield damage.
    All elemental attacks in the game have a gauge value: 1A, 2B, 4C,
    and these are hardcoded into the game.
    Elemental attacks can apply the corresponding element as a status to the target.
    The higher the number on the gauge, the longer the status lasts.
    When another element is applied to a target with a status, an elemental reaction occurs.
    Elemental reactions can deplete the gauge on the status.
    If the applied element has a high enough gauge, it can even remove the existing status from the target.
    Otherwise, the status will decay naturally with enough time.
    <!--For example, if one applies 2B pyro to an enemy. -->
  </p>
  <p>
    Most attacks in the game are 1A. Certain skills such as Bennett's E and many bursts (Childe, Raiden, Hu Tao Q) are 2B.
    Swirl can apply 2B of the corresponding infused element.
    Beidou's Q (initial hit) is 4C electro.
  </p>
  <p>
    Elemental reactions can also be used to damage enemy shields.
    The damage done to the shield is the gauge value of the attack times the reaction coefficient (RC)
    associated with the reaction triggered.
    $$D_R = \text{gauge value}\times\text{RC}$$
    For example, applying pyro on cryo has an RC of 2.
    So applying 2B pyro on a cryo shield will deal \(2\times 2 = 4\) gauge units (GU) of shield damage.
    Some other RC values are as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pyro on Hydro: 0.5</li>
    <li>Pyro on Cryo: 2</li>
    <li>Pyro on Electro: 1</li>
    <li>Hydro on Pyro: 2</li>
    <li>Hydro on Cryo: 0</li>
    <li>Hydro on Electro: depends (0.8)</li>
    <li>Cryo on Pyro: 0.5</li>
    <li>Cryo on Hydro: 1</li>
    <li>Cryo on Electro: 1</li>
    <li>Electro on Pyro: 1</li>
    <li>Electro on Hydro: depends (0.8)</li>
    <li>Electro on Cryo: 1</li>
    <li>Swirl, Crystallize: 0.5</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note Electro-Charged (EC) is unique in that the gauge damage can be dealt in several ticks over time.
    Also these RC values are actually different for Fatui armor.
  </p>
  <p>The game code uses the term Elemental Durability instead of GU.
    The conversion ratio is 1 GU = 25 units Element Durability.
  </p>

  <h3>Poise damage</h3>
  <p>If an attack is heavy/blunt, then it can deal poise damage to certain shields (geo, frozen).
    Poise damage is a hidden attribute hardcoded into all attacks in the game.
    Usually higher poise damage means it can stagger targets more easily.
    Attacks also have an impulse/force level that determines whether they can lift enemies into the air as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some shields are mostly poise-based. For example, ores are 'shields' that require a certain amount of poise damage before breaking.
    Poise damage is converted into shield damage as follows
    $$D_P = \text{poise damage}\times \text{poise coefficient}$$
    The poise coefficient (PC) is as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Heavy attack on Geo shield: .014</li>
    <li>Melee attack on Geo shield: .002</li>
    <li>Heavy attack on Frozen/Cryo shield: .006</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If an attack is both heavy and melee, then the PC will be the one for heavy attacks (the max of the PC).</p>
  <p>Some examples of really heavy attacks (high poise damage and blunt) include
    Xiao's plunging, Morax's meteor, Morax's hold stele, Claymore swings, Yoimiya's burst explosion, Overloaded reactions, etc.
  </p>

  <h3>Normal damage</h3>
  <p>
    Some shields can be broken simply by doing any damage to them (e.g. Abyss shields). The conversion is
    $$D_N = \frac{.2\times\text{Damage}}{\text{Enemy HP}} \times \text{Shield Gauge}$$
  </p>

  <h3>Total damage</h3>
  <p>
    The total damage done to the shield is just the sum
    $$D_S = D_R + D_P + D_N$$
    Note that some shields cannot be damaged by poise or normal damage (such as the hypostasis shields).
    In that case, the corresponding terms are ommitted from above.
