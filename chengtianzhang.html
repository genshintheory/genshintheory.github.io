  <p>Chengtianzhang (成田章) is a mentioned character in Genshin.
    Those who understand Chinese characters will know who we are referring to.
  </p>
  <p>We have recently received Qiqi's birthday message, titled Shengri Yuanwang (生日愿望).
    We have also been paying attention to the recent event in Wangshu Inn
    as well as the choice of 4 stars Xinyan, Ningguang on Xiao's banner.
    So it seems mihoyo wants to send a message about Chengtianzhang.
  </p><p>
    In fact, we can almost guess what mihoyo want to say.
    Remember in the 3.7 event when Cyno was praising the Genius Invokation card game, only for Garvipidam to be revealed after.
    Or remember in 4.3 when Sir Arthur briefly mentioned Navia Caspar in one of his dialogue options.
    When Arlecchino releases, she will probably have new voicelines on the other harbingers.
    Technically, Capitano's rank is unconfirmed.
