<title>Chengtianzhang</title>

  <p>Chengtianzhang (成田章) is a mentioned character in Genshin.
    Those who understand Chinese characters will know who we are referring to.
  </p>
  <p>We have recently received Qiqi's birthday message, titled Shengri Yuanwang (生日愿望).
    We have also been paying attention to the recent event in Wangshu Inn
    as well as the choice of 4 stars Xinyan, Ningguang on Xiao's banner.
    So it seems mihoyo wants to send a message about Chengtianzhang.
  </p><p>
    In fact, we can almost guess what mihoyo want to say.
    Remember in the 3.7 event when Cyno was praising the Genius Invokation card game, only for Garvipidam to be revealed after.
    Or remember in 4.3 when Sir Arthur briefly mentioned Navia Caspar in one of his dialogue options.
    When Arlecchino releases, she will probably have new voicelines on the other harbingers.
    Technically, Capitano's rank is unconfirmed.
    So mihoyo probably wants Arlecchino to say something about Capitano, similar to what Cyno said about Genius Invokation or Arthur said about Navia.
    However, mihoyo has faced some resistance, and thus Huangquan got butchered, and there is extremely ominous foreshadowing in the following weeks prior to Arlecchino's debut.
    Moreover, Xbalanque may probably appear in Natlan, so mihoyo probably wanted to propose some compromise involving Xbalanque, Arlecchino, and Capitano.
  </p><p>
    What exactly does mihoyo want Arlecchino to say about Chengtianzhang?
    We can probably guess: mihoyo probably wants Arlecchino to confirm Chengtianzhang's rank, perhaps say that Chengtianzhang is the 1st harbinger.
    Or perhaps mihoyo wants Arlecchino to say that Chengtianzhang is one of the strongest harbingers in Teyvat.
