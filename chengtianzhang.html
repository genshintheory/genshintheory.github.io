<title>Chengtianzhang</title>

  <p>Chengtianzhang (成田章) is a mentioned character in Genshin.
    Those who understand Chinese characters will know who we are referring to.
  </p>
  <p>We have recently received Qiqi's birthday message, titled Shengri Yuanwang (生日愿望).
    We have also been paying attention to the recent event in Wangshu Inn
    as well as the choice of 4 stars Xinyan, Ningguang on Xiao's banner.
    So it seems mihoyo wants to send a message about Chengtianzhang.
  </p><p>
    In fact, we can almost guess what mihoyo want to say.
    Remember in the 3.7 event when Cyno was praising the Genius Invokation card game, only for Garvipidam to be revealed after.
    Or remember in 4.3 when Sir Arthur briefly mentioned Navia Caspar in one of his dialogue options.
    When Arlecchino releases, she will probably have new voicelines on the other harbingers.
    Technically, Capitano's rank is unconfirmed.
    So mihoyo probably wants Arlecchino to say something about Capitano, similar to what Cyno said about Genius Invokation or Arthur said about Navia.
    However, mihoyo has faced some resistance, and thus Huangquan got butchered, and there is extremely ominous foreshadowing in the following weeks prior to Arlecchino's debut.
    Moreover, Xbalanque may probably appear in Natlan, so mihoyo probably wanted to propose some compromise involving Xbalanque, Arlecchino, and Capitano.
  </p><p>
    What exactly does mihoyo want Arlecchino to say about Chengtianzhang?
    We can probably guess: mihoyo probably wants Arlecchino to confirm Chengtianzhang's rank, perhaps say that Chengtianzhang is the 1st harbinger.
    Or perhaps mihoyo wants Arlecchino to say that Chengtianzhang is one of the strongest harbingers in Teyvat.
    Perhaps mihoyo's dream is for Arlecchino to say that Chengtianzhang is so strong that he is in a similar power league as Xbalanque, Xiao, Navia, and perhaps some others.
    And why does mihoyo want Chengtianzhang to be 1st harbinger (in what headcanon)? 
    Because Cheng 成 is also used in the name of Genghis Khan (成吉思汗 Chinggis Khan), 
    the emperor of the Mongols who founded the Yuan dynasty (元朝), and this game is called Genshin/Yuanshen (原神).
  </p><p>
    So basically mihoyo wants to use Arlecchino as a puppet to set up Chengtianzhang, to use the knave as a knave,
    but mihoyo has faced resistance.
    And mihoyo's warning is if we are not allowed to have Arlecchino say good things about Chengtianzhang's rank and strength, 
    then we will treat her badly like Argenti and Huangquan, butcher her kit, and put her stats below Xiao.
    Basically putting all of her stats below Xiao is equivalent to the death penalty, when you look at Huangquan, Argenti, Ratio.
    And it is much worse because now we are dealing with names that sound like real people (libel, defamation), whereas Yoimiya and Yae are more fictional names.
  </p><p>
    Based on ranking, as the 4th harbinger, Arlecchino's atk may probably be around Diluc's level.
    We just hope her def and hp are also buff like Diluc's so that she has at least one stat higher than each other character.
  </p>

  <h2>Deal</h2>
  <p>In light of the above, we are willing to make a deal.
    We are fine if mihoyo writers want Arlecchino to say Chengtianzhang/Capitano is the 1st harbinger or comment on his power level.
    In exchange, we need Arlecchino pyro sword to have at least def or hp or both higher than Xiao so that she has at least one stat higher than each other character.
    Moreover, we are fine if you want to say Chengtianzhang is strong, but we also need Acheron to have highest base atk in Star Rail.
    And as an extra, we are fine if Sam has highest hp in Star Rail.
    Moreover, you can give Aventurine highest def in game (higher than Gepard). Otherwise, looking at Veritas Ratio's atk it is just sketchy.
  </p>

  <h2>Strongest in Teyvat? The world? In history?</h2>
  <p>If you want Arlecchino to say that Chengtianzhang is the strongest warrior in the world, even stronger than Navia or Xiao, then it is ok.
    We are fine if the storywriters do that, but in exchange, we need Arlecchino, pyro sword, to have def, hp, or one stat higher than Navia, Xiao, and all other characters.
    And Acheron needs the highest atk in Star Rail (Aventurine can have def higher than Gepard, Sam can have highest hp).
    If Arlecchino's stats suffer the same treatment as Argenti or Huangquan (compared to Ratio), then please just give the knave the death penalty.
    We don't want the knave to appear as a playable character or 4.6 to air if she has to suffer that kind of humiliation and defamation.
  </p><p>
    In summary, we are fine if you want Arlecchino to say Chengtianzhang is the strongest in the world.
