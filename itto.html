  <p>Arataki Itto, the one and oni, is the best Geo DPS in the game.</p>
  <p>He is basically a much better version of Noelle and Ningguang combined.</p>
  
  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <h3>Normal Attack</h3>
  <p>His special charged attacks are the core of his kit from C0 to C6.
  They consume stacks but do not consume stamina.
  Itto can gain stacks through normal attacks and Ushi.
  His burst and constellations make it easier to gain more stacks.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Elemental Skill</h3>
  <p>He yeets pet bull Ushi, which does more damage than Zhongli's meteor.
  He can aim it too, and Ushi taunts enemies.
  Ushi has the same HP as Itto and will give him more stacks.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Elemental Burst</h3>
  <p>This functions as a buff that converts DEF to ATK.
  It can snapshot DEF boosts such as Gorou's E but does not snapshot ATK boosts such as Bennett's Q.
  At C0, Itto's DEF to ATK conversion has higher scaling than a C0-C5 Noelle,
  but lower scaling than a C6 Noelle.
  At C6, Itto's DEF to ATK conversion (122% DEF) is still lower than C6 Noelle (135% DEF).
  Noelle also has larger AoE and can heal.
  However Itto has higher base DEF than Noelle and another passive that increases DMG based on DEF.
  Moreover, Itto attacks faster than Noelle.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Constellations</h2>
  <p>His C6 is one of the strongest in the game and can allow for 'infinite' charged attack spam.
  His CA has a 50% chance not to consume a stack,
  so on average he can do twice as many CA.
  </p><p>
  Itto's C6 is laughably better than ganyu's C6.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Build</h2>
  <h3>Artifacts</h3>
  <p>4 piece Husk of Opulent Dreams is his bis.
  DEF sands, Geo DMG goblet, CRIT circlet.
  Substats: CRIT > DEF, ER.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Weapons</h3>
  <p>
  Redhorn is his clear bis. 
  For 4 stars, the Whiteblind is his best option for damage and is competitive with the other 5 star claymores (except Redhorn).
  However the Sacrificial Greatsword is also good for energy and accumulating stacks with Ushi 
  (though the Sacrificial Greatsword will not do as much damage as the Whiteblind).
  </p><p>
  The interesting thing about Itto is that you can give him a Level 1 weapon (even a Debate Club),
  and he will still do reasonable damage if you level all his other artifacts and talents.
  This is because his DEF to ATK conversion, which makes the base ATK on the weapon not as important
  as for other hypercarries in the game.
  This is why running Sacrificial Greatsword for the extra ER and charges on Ushi
  can sometimes lead to smoother and even faster clears than running a Whiteblind while struggling with ER.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Teams</h2>
  <p>Itto's best teams are usually mono Geo teams with a healer (to fight the rifthounds).
    Itto's best teams usually always have Gorou.
    Itto-Gorou-Albedo
    is a core that has the most synergy since all 3 units have DEF scaling,
    with Gorou buffing both Itto and Albedo
    and Albedo providing off field dps to Itto.
    The last slot is flex, usually someone like Diona or Bennett who can heal.
  </p><p>
  Itto can be paired with Zhongli too.
  However they do not really have the best synergy since Itto scales with DEF while Zhongli scales with HP.
  Zhongli is usually more valuable on say a Xiao team.
  Itto already gets -20% Geo RES shred from Geo resonance with Itto-Gorou.
  Based on the way Gorou works, the team only really needs a max of 3 Geo characters.
  And Albedo synergizes better with Itto-Gorou than Zhongli does.
  </p><p>
  Raiden Shogun can work for ER generation, but usually when Itto is ran in Geo teams he generates enough energy already,
  so Raiden becomes a luxury.
  Kokomi can also work as a healer slot.
  Mona can extra provide DMG Bonus to Itto.
  </p><p>
  Kazuha or Venti can help complement Itto's lack of large AoE.
  Itto does have decent local AoE. 
  It is bigger than Hu Tao's, but it is not as large as some of the top AoE characters.
  </p><p>
  As with all DPS that rely on their Normal Attack, Childe can help boost the level of Itto's NA by 1.
