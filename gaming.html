  <p>Gaming is 4 star pyro Xiao.
    But with Xianyun and Furina, anyone can be Xiao.
    Xianyun and Furina have brought Xiao to the masses.
  </p><p>
    Gaming's constellation is called Leo Expergiscens (醒狮座).
  </p>

  <h1>Kit</h1>
  <p>The E plunge (Charmed Cloudstrider) has 414.72% scaling at lv10.
    This is a bit less than Diluc high plunge (which is apparently the highest plunge scaling in the game).
    The interesting thing is that Gaming's high plunge scaling (AA not E) is 316.69% at lv10,
    so it seems Diluc's plunge is just unusually high.
    Other characters with higher-than-normal or different plunge scalings (compared to others of same weapon type) are Xiao, Itto, kazuha.
  </p><p>
    Note that Gaming's E plunge does not have collision damage.
    Diluc and claymores generally have large hitboxes so they can hit do collision damage with AA,
    which can contribute a decent portion of dps
    (for Xiao it can be a 1.4 times increase, equivalent to Raiden C2).
  </p>
  <p>
    Gaming's E consumes 15% hp and has 6s cd.
    With his passive, after plunging his hp will heal 1.5% for 4 times in .8s.
    The unfortunate thing is that the Marechaussee set does not buff plunging dmg (only NA/CA).
    But it makes historical sense given what Zhu Di did to Fang Xiaoru.
    But with Gaming's release, now it does not make historical sense since the Ming dynasty was ruled by the house of Zhu.

    His Q Suanni's Gilded Dance summons a Man Chai.
    The stance lasts 12s and has 60 energy cost (15s cd).
  </p>

  <h1>Teams</h1>
  <p>Bennett-Xianyun-Furina-Gaming (vape plunge).
    Bennett-Gaming-Xianyun-Cryo (melt plunge).
    The cryo applicator can be Charlotte, Rosaria, Kaeya, etc.
  </p>


  <h1>Calculations</h1>
  <p>During his Q (12s) he can do 4-6 plunges.
    The reason is because his E and throwing his Man Chai have longer animations (than Xiao) so it takes more time to reset E and plunge again.
    Suppose
