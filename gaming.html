<title>Gaming</title>

  </head>
  
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>


  <p>Gaming is 4 star pyro Xiao.
    But with Xianyun and Furina, anyone can be Xiao.
    Xianyun and Furina have brought Xiao to the masses.
  </p><p>
    Gaming's constellation is called Leo Expergiscens (醒狮座).
  </p>
  <p>Gaming is apparently the 4 star with the highest base atk (higher than Childe, less than Shenhe), having usurped Freminet (4.0).
    So it is similar to how Alatus Xiao is the 5 star male with highest base atk.
    Xiao is still king.
  </p>

  <p>Gaming has a pet named Man Chai (文仔 Wenzai).</p>


  <h1>Kit</h1>
  <p>The E plunge (Charmed Cloudstrider) has 414.72% scaling at lv10.
    This is a bit less than Diluc high plunge (which is apparently the highest plunge scaling in the game).
    The interesting thing is that Gaming's high plunge scaling (AA not E) is 316.69% at lv10,
    so it seems Diluc's plunge is just unusually high.
    Other characters with higher-than-normal or different plunge scalings (compared to others of same weapon type) are Xiao, Itto, kazuha.
  </p><p>
    Note that Gaming's E plunge does not have collision damage.
    Diluc and claymores generally have large hitboxes so they can hit do collision damage with AA,
    which can contribute a decent portion of dps
    (for Xiao it can be a 1.4 times increase, equivalent to Raiden C2).
  </p>
  <p>
    Gaming's E consumes 15% hp and has 6s cd.
    With his passive, after plunging his hp will heal 1.5% for 4 times in .8s.
    The unfortunate thing is that the Marechaussee set does not buff plunging dmg (only NA/CA).
    But it makes historical sense given what Zhu Di did to Fang Xiaoru.
    But with Gaming's release, now it does not make historical sense since the Ming dynasty was ruled by the house of Zhu.
  </p><p>
    His test run had him on 4p Crimson.
    Still, the hp fluctuation makes him synergize with Furina's Q
    in building fanfare stacks (more dmg bonus).
  </p>

  <p>
    His Q Suanni's Gilded Dance summons a Man Chai.
    The stance lasts 12s and has 60 energy cost (15s cd).
    The Q also applies pyro to him (cleanses).
    During the Q he gets to use his E more and plunge.
    However, he will not be able to plunge as frequently with his E as Xiao.
  </p>

  <!-- collision plunge cannot vape?
    xy allow gaming use AA plunge (not just E all time)
    Bennett c6
   -->

   <h2>Constellations</h2>
   <p>C1 makes his Q heal more.
    C2 makes overflow healing increase his atk by 20%.
    C3 gives E levels.
    C4 gives energy.
    C5 gives Q levels.
    C6 gives 80 cv and increased aoe on plunge.
  </p>


  <h1>Build</h1>
  <p>WGS, Redhorn, Caiduan, Skyward, Blackcliff, etc. are all fine.
    Serpent Spine can be bis (when with Xianyun as XY buff depends on her atk not his, so dmg bonus benefits comapred to the high base atk 5*).
    R5 Rainslasher and Mailed Flower (EM) can be good f2p 4* for reaction teams.
    Funny enough, his E cannot proc the Bacon passive as his hp drain does not count as getting damage (unlike Dehya).
    <!-- as his E cast does not deal dmg and his charmed cloudstrider is a plunge not E. -->
    Sacrificial could be a meme but viable because of ER.
    Fav is also fine for ER.
  </p><p>
    4p Crimson can actually work as he uses his E multiple times.
    Mare could work but the 2p is wasted.
    4p Vermillion can actually work.
    Mixed sets could work like 2p pyro-2p atk.
  </p><p>
    Interestingly there is not really a tailor set for plunging specifically (i.e. plunging shreds 10% def, stacking up to 6 times).
    We do not know what devs are so afraid of, releasing a plunging set.
    They seemed fine releasing a set named after zhu, despite what Zhu Yuanzhang and Zhu Di did to China.
    But it is not like such a set would be uber broken for C6 Xiao (who is E dps), but it would still benefit C0-C5.
  </p>
  <p>ATK-Pyro-Crit is standard
    If with Xianyun, EM-Pyro-Crit can work for vape/melt teams.
  </p>


  <h1>Teams</h1>
  <p>Bennett-Xianyun-Furina-Gaming (vape plunge).
    As he can fluctuate his HP a lot, Gaming does have synergy with Furina (alongside Xiao, Wrio).
    A certain special somebody remarked that double hydro (Yelan/XQ) with Furina and XY would be a dps upgrade.
  </p><p>
    Bennett-Gaming-Xianyun/Kazuha-Cryo (melt plunge).
    The cryo applicator can be Charlotte, Rosaria, Kaeya, etc.
  </p><p>
    Burgeon: Nahida-Furina-Gaming-Bennett.
    Mono pyro: Lyney-Bennett-Gaming-XL/vv/Morax.
    Chevy: Gaming-Bennett-Chev-electro.
  </p>


  <h1>Calculations</h1>
  <p>During his Q (12s duration, 15s cd) he can do 4-6 plunges.
    The reason is because his E and throwing his Man Chai have longer animations (than Xiao) so it takes more time to reset E and plunge again.
    Suppose we are generous and he does 6 high plunges.
    <!-- in practice maybe 4-5 -->
    The dps is
    $$x = 6*1.466*414.72/15 = 243.191808$$
    This is without reactions, and it is cope.
  </p><p>
    But if he can melt (2x multiplier) this can jump to
    $$2x = 486.383616$$
    And with Xianyun it can jump higher.
    Now this is actually high for a 4 star.
  </p>

  <p>Gaming is like Cyno in that he can generate energy with his E during Q.
    Apparently there is icd for particle generation too.
    So every other skill he can generate energy.
    Based on some calcs, Gaming's C0 ER requirements can be 140-180% (to spam burst on cd).
