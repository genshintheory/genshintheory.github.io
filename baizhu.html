    Before version 3.4, a trailer released featuring Xiao, Qiqi, and Baizhu.
    It showed Xiao vanquishing demons and then getting rushed to the emergency room by Qiqi.
    When Xiao woke up, he found that the doctor treating him was none other than the weirdo Baizhu.
    Xiao then immediately fled the Liyue hospital.

    Yes, that is exactly what Fang Xiaoru would have done if he found that the doctor 
    reviving him from the dead was none other than Zhu Di, the Yongle bastard.
    Fang Xiaoru would immediately flee the hospital and find someone else to cure him (like Alhaitham).
    Even though Alhaitham is not a doctor, Alhaitham would be able to cure Fang Xiaoru better than Baizhu.
    I would not trust my life with Baizhu either.
