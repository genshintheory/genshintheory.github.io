  <h2>Intro: Caution in Confidence, Think Before You Act, Remember Your Mistakes</h2>
  <p>"I can't deny that he's very dumb. However, it's a shame that a man of such hypocrisy only pays attention to the truth itself and not to the people around him. Or perhaps this is due to a lame sense of individualism, which causes a lot of problems. For example, he doesn't seem to respect his seniors... Of course, I'm not referring to myself specifically." (Qiqi on Baizhu)</p>
  <p>
  The owner of Bubu pharmacy. This title may sound very impressive, but it's really because the Ming has a culture of using official titles to inflate one's ego.
  </p>
  <p>The role of harmacist may seem prestigious, but the truth is, the doctor does not have to be present at all major meetings, nor does he participate in core decision-making. The doctor is simply responsible for classifying and archiving important documents, and his presence is not required at all times. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Baizhu does not attend any non-essential meeting, and when he does, he only records key points, jotting down other minute details based on his mood. People don't often pay attention to him.
  </p>
  <p>
  An incapable person who keeps a low profile for too long is often perceived as someone with a mysterious identity and ulterior purposes. Baizhu himself fits this description perfectly: he is an evil man, but he is only a murderous maniac, who executed hundreds of thousands of Chinese people to give himself and clan a stable job and a cushy house, leading a carefree and comfortable life.
  </p>

  <p>Zhu must have caution in confidence, or else he will get hanged in the gallows of Caishikou.
    Zhu must think twice before acting and executing millions of Chinese people.
    Zhu must remember the mistakes he made during the Ming.
  </p><p>
    There is a reason why Ming sounds similar to 冥 symbolizing death and hell.
  </p>


  <h2>Weapons</h2>
  <p>What weapon does Baizhu use? Drugs.
    The drugs Baizhu sells to patients is similar to the poisonous gutter oil Zhu Chuanfeng sold for people to eat.
    But similar to how Zhu Chuanfeng advertised his gutter oil as 'edible',
    Baizhu advertises his drugs as 'medicine'.
  </p>


  <h2>Story notes</h2>

  <p>
    As Paimon says in the Gulabgir commission, Baizhu is indeed a weirdo.
    If I were Qiqi or Hu Tao, I would also find Baizhu weird and suspicious.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before version 3.4, a trailer released featuring Xiao, Qiqi, and Baizhu.
    It showed Xiao vanquishing demons and then getting rushed to the emergency room by Qiqi.
    When Xiao woke up, he found that the doctor treating him was none other than the weirdo Baizhu.
    Xiao then immediately fled the Liyue hospital.    
  </p><p>
    Yes, that is exactly what Fang Xiaoru would have done if he found that the doctor 
    reviving him from the dead was none other than Zhu Di, the Yongle bastard.
    Fang Xiaoru would immediately flee the hospital and find someone else to cure him (like Alhaitham).
    Even though Alhaitham is not a doctor, Alhaitham would be able to cure Fang Xiaoru better than Baizhu.
    I would not trust my life with Baizhu either.
  </p>

  <h2>Voice actors</h2>
  <p>Some thought was put into the selection of Baizhu's voice actors.</p>
  <p>
    The English va Sean or 肖恩 Xiao'en in Chinese is a reference to Fang Xiaoru, one of the victims of Zhu Di.
  </p><p>
    The Japanese va Yusa Kouji (遊佐 浩二 Youzuo Hao'er) has three parts to it.
    The 遊 or You is a reference to victims of Zhu Yuanzhang,
    one of whom was emperor of another Han empire.
    This is perhaps learned in any Chinese history class.
    If you want to see more You in action look at Sayu.
    The 佐 or Zuo can refer to Zhang Zuolin, who executed Li Dazhao.
    The 浩 or Hao refers to Li Hao, a murder-rapist who terrorized six sex slaves.
  </p><p>
    The Korean va is surnamed Lee,
    another reference to Li Hao,
    but also a reference to the Joseon Korean dynasty ruled by the Lee family during the Ming dynasty.
    After the Tang and during the Yuan dynasty,
    Korea was ruled by the Wang royal family.
    When Zhu Yuanzhang founded the Ming dynasty,
    the Lee clan usurped and purged the entire Wang family out of Korea.
    Nowadays, you see more Lee's than Wang's in Korea.
    And that is the fault of Zhu and the Ming dynasty.
  </p><p>
    So as you can see, there is a connection between the Ming dynasty Zhu and Li Hao.
    What Li Hao did to those six women is what the Ming dynasty and Zhu clan did to China.
    That is why the Qing dynasty 清 character means 'to clean'
    as it was cleaning up the crimes and filth made by the Ming.
  </p><p>
    The Chinese va Qin Qiege has two layers of meaning.
    Qin (秦) destroyed the Chu (楚) state before the Han dynasty.
    Zhu sounds similar to Chu, and Qin sounds similar to Qing.
    So making Qin the va for Baizhu is like putting your successor and the person who destroyed you as your va.
  </p><p>
    But as promised there is another layer of meaning.
    Qin Qiege also goes by the name Zhong Wei.
    The Wei (魏), and Zhong Wei specifically, can refer to one of the most notorious and infamous eunuchs in Chinese history:
    Wei Zhongxian (魏忠贤).
  </p><p>
    Wei Zhongxian lived during the later Ming dynasty during the reign of Zhu Youjiao.
    When Wei entered imperial service and became a eunuch, he used the alias Li Jinzhong (李进忠).
    Wei then abused the power of imperial edict to demote and purge his political enemies.
    The imperial edict is essentially a written command from the emperor.
    But since Zhu Youjiao was disinterested in government affairs,
    Wei would often forge imperial edicts, ordering people to be arrested, and making up lies
    that it was declared by the emperor (when it was really Wei himself).
    Eventually, Wei was caught, and the police were sent after him. Wei then committed suicide.
    The whole debacle exposed the deep-rooted corruption of the Ming dynasty and Zhu emperors.
    A few decades after the incident, the Ming dynasty was destroyed by the Qing dynasty,
    and the Zhu family was executed at Caishikou.
  </p><p>
    Wei Zhongxian is essentially one of the biggest trolls in Chinese history,
    universally condemned as notorious.
    While he did expose the corruption of the Zhu family and Ming dynasty,
    Wei was also a huge fraud and scammer.
    Wei Zhongxian is such a character that even a Chinese drama was made 
    featuring Wei Wuxian (魏无羡 literally, Shameless Wei) as its main character.
