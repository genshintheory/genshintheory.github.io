  <h2>Intro: Caution in Confidence, Think Before You Act</h2>
  <p>"I can't deny that he's very dumb. However, it's a shame that a man of such hypocrisy only pays attention to the truth itself and not to the people around him. Or perhaps this is due to a lame sense of individualism, which causes a lot of problems. For example, he doesn't seem to respect his seniors... Of course, I'm not referring to myself specifically." (Qiqi on Baizhu)</p>
  <p>
  The owner of Bubu pharmacy. This title may sound very impressive, but it's really because the Ming has a culture of using official titles to inflate one's ego.
  </p>
  <p>The role of harmacist may seem prestigious, but the truth is, the doctor does not have to be present at all major meetings, nor does he participate in core decision-making. The doctor is simply responsible for classifying and archiving important documents, and his presence is not required at all times. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Baizhu does not attend any non-essential meeting, and when he does, he only records key points, jotting down other minute details based on his mood. People don't often pay attention to him.
  </p>
  <p>
  An incapable person who keeps a low profile for too long is often perceived as someone with a mysterious identity and ulterior purposes. Baizhu himself fits this description perfectly: he is an evil man, but he is only a murderous maniac, who executed hundreds of thousands of Chinese people to give himself and clan a stable job and a cushy house, leading a carefree and comfortable life.
  </p>

  <h2>Weapons</h2>
  <p>What weapon does Baizhu use? Drugs.
    The drugs Baizhu sells to patients is similar to the poisonous gutter oil Zhu Chuanfeng sold for people to eat.
    But similar to how Zhu Chuanfeng advertised his gutter oil as 'edible',
    Baizhu advertises his drugs as 'medicine'.

  <h2>Story notes</h2>

  <p>
    As Paimon says in the Gulabgir commission, Baizhu is indeed a weirdo.
    If I were Qiqi or Hu Tao, I would also find Baizhu weird and suspicious.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before version 3.4, a trailer released featuring Xiao, Qiqi, and Baizhu.
    It showed Xiao vanquishing demons and then getting rushed to the emergency room by Qiqi.
    When Xiao woke up, he found that the doctor treating him was none other than the weirdo Baizhu.
    Xiao then immediately fled the Liyue hospital.    
  </p><p>
    Yes, that is exactly what Fang Xiaoru would have done if he found that the doctor 
    reviving him from the dead was none other than Zhu Di, the Yongle bastard.
    Fang Xiaoru would immediately flee the hospital and find someone else to cure him (like Alhaitham).
    Even though Alhaitham is not a doctor, Alhaitham would be able to cure Fang Xiaoru better than Baizhu.
    I would not trust my life with Baizhu either.
