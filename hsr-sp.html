  <p>Skill Points (SP) are used by characters to cast skills.
    Some characters want to use their skills all the time, such as Jing Yuan or Yukong, generally consuming SP each turn.
  </p><p>
    Other characters do not necessarily consume SP every turn or can restore SP after consuming them.
    These include Seele, Blade, Bronya, etc.
    Such characters may be called 'SP neutral'.
  </p><p>
    And then there are some characters that typically generate SP each turn for the rest of the team,
    not having to use their skills all the time.
    This can include Silver Wolf, Luocha, etc.
    Such characters may be called 'SP positive'.
