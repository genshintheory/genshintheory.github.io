  <h2>Genshin equivalent</h2>
  <p>Having a healer that can revive characters at c0 would be nice.
    Barbara and Qiqi are constellation locked for this resurrection skill.
  </p><p>
    Other than that, the unique thing about Bailu's kit is her E healing.
    It bounces between characters.
    It heals the selected character and then 2 random characters (can be the same character).
    After each bounce, healing is reduced 15% (attenuation).
    This is not 'smart' healing, but more like random healing.
  </p><p>
    Having a 'smart' healer in Genshin could also be helpful.
    They heal the whole party, but those with less hp get healed more.
    For example, say the healer E will heal a total amount of X.
    The X gets distributed between the 4 party members in proportion to those that need the healing the most.
  </p>
  <p>Algorithm / Formula (max cap):
    Let X be the total healing amount and \(h_i \) be the hp of the party members.
    Take the character with the highest current hp (not max hp). Call this highest current hp \(M = \max h_i \).
  </p><p>
    We do not look at percentage hp lost.
    One party member could have 20k out of 80k hp (25%), but the other members have 10k out of 20k hp (50%).
    In this case the healing would go to the party members with 10k hp as they have smaller absolute value of hp.
