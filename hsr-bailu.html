  <h2>Genshin equivalent</h2>
  <p>Having a healer that can revive characters at c0 would be nice.
    Barbara and Qiqi are constellation locked for this resurrection skill.
  </p><p>
    Other than that, the unique thing about Bailu's kit is her E healing.
    It bounces between characters.
    Having a 'smart' healer in Genshin could also be helpful.
    They heal the whole party, but those with less hp get healed more.
    For example, say the healer E will heal a total amount of X.
    The X gets distributed between the 4 party members in proportion to those that need the healing the most.
