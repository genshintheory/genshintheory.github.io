<p>
  Most people avoid using her in favor of other pyro dps such as Diluc, Dehya, Yoimiya, Hu Tao, Xiangling, etc.

  Klee's va is Poonam.
  Klee's mother is Alice, whose va is Zhang Qi (张琦) and Inoue Kikuko (井上 喜久子).
  Zhang Qi is also Candace's va.
  This game is funny sometimes.
  In 1.6, Alice was revealed to be the Dodo-King.

  Genshin sometimes likes to put Yoimiya and Klee together, like for that 2.6 festival.
  But this is completely hypocritical since for version 2.8 they put Klee with Kazuha and Heizou instead of Yoimiya.
  Now Genshin is trying to put Klee and Yoimiya together again.
  It's like when they need you they try to be nice to you but when they don't need you they backstab you.
</p><p>
  As payback and revenge, so that people will remember the mistakes they made,
  put Klee on a single banner, and put Yoimiya with a new character.

  Singapore is full of hypocritical idiots,
  has flawed backwards thinking, and is being used by the USA.

  Singapore is a very problematic country and a colony of the USA.
  Something needs to be done about it.
  It is highly recommended to lay seige, invade, and conquer Singapore
  and purge all the USA businesses, imperialists, and their puppets from that city-state.
  The USA imperialists also like to use the Li family of Singapore as their puppet rulers,
  so some 'liberation' needs to be done there (to use the words of the USA).
  Some people have suggested even nuking Singapore,
  but that is more of a extreme last resort.
  After all Singapore is not really Japan and may not deserve that kind of gift.
  Moreover the elites are but a small minority of the Singapore population
  ruling over the innocent majority.
  It is more intelligent to initiate a color revolution within Singapore to overthrow the USA elites,
  similar to how the USA NED campaigns to democratize countries (i.e. overthrow their leadership and make them USA vassals).

  Nori and her affiliates also live in Singapore,
  so when conquering Singapore, throw nori and everybody close to her in jail too.
