<p>
  Most people avoid using her in favor of other pyro dps such as Diluc, Hu Tao, Yoimiya, Xiangling, etc.
 </p><p>
  Klee's va is Poonam.
  Klee's mother is Alice, whose va is Zhang Qi (张琦) and Inoue Kikuko (井上 喜久子).
  Zhang Qi is also Candace's va.
  This game is funny sometimes.
  In 1.6, Alice was revealed to be the Dodo-King.
 </p>
<p>
  Genshin sometimes likes to put Yoimiya and Klee together, like for that 2.6 festival.
  But this is completely hypocritical since for version 2.8 they put Klee with Kazuha and Heizou instead of Yoimiya.
  Now Genshin is trying to put Klee and Yoimiya together again.
  It's like when they need you they try to be nice to you but when they don't need you they backstab you.
</p><p>
  As payback and revenge, so that those marketing idiots will remember the mistakes they made,
  put Klee on a single banner, and put Yoimiya with another character a new character.
</p><p>
  The marketing team is full of hypocritical idiots,
  has flawed backwards thinking, and is being used by the USA and Singapore.
</p><p>
  Singapore is a very problematic country and a colony of the USA.
  Something needs to be done about it.
  Bankrupt every business in Singapore, assassinate all their leadership,
  seige and take over the entire entire city.
  Even nuke it.
  Singapore is an insignificant speck of dust in the world, so it deserves to be treated as such.
</p><p>
	The Lee family of Singapore needs to be exterminated completely.
	Lee Kuan Yew is a traitor and USA puppet.
	Same with Lee Hsien Loong.
	Their whole family acts like Li Hao.
