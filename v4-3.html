<title>Version 4.3</title>

  </head>
  
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>


<p>As 4.3 is already F tier,
  all cases of corruption that occur in 4.3
  will negatively impact the rating of 4.4.
  Just like how there is overflow healing, we call this overflow penalty.
</p><p>
  Moreover, 4.3 just so happens to have several birthdays.
  In the past, Genshin has had a poor history of attacking people on certain birthdays ('birthday gifts').
  So we will count the number of political attacks made on birthdays in 4.3.
  The higher this number, the lower 4.4's rating will be (as well as 4.x as a whole).
  Moreover, if this number is high enough, there may be other unforseen consequences.
</p>


<h1>Banners</h1>
<p>Looks like this is a Xiao version.
  We have Yoimiya, Xiao N, Xiaogan,
  and then throw in a random Raiden Shogun.
</p>
<p>Chiori was also introduced in this version.</p>

<p>It also looks like the banner selectors are so concerned with prolonging the reign of certain people
  and benefitting their families while attacking all other Chinese people.
  Moreover, they want to build monopolies around certain kinds of characters while exluding all other people.
  This kind of selection bias represents the worst effects of unbridled capitalism on society
  and is a reason why markets cannot and should not be completely free.
  If private businesses were completely allowed to make all decisions on their own,
  they would just be manipulated by USA media easily, and the USA hegemony does not have the best interest of society in mind.
</p><p>
  There needs to be a law saying that if private corporations act to serve the interests of USA hegemony while harming all Chinese people,
  then those corporations can be dissolved, liquidated, with all their assets turned over to the treasury 
  and orgchart and staff subject to replacement and rearrangement by centralized authority.
  Moreover such corporations can be accused of treason for collusion with USA 5th column elements.
</p><p>
  Sometimes it is better to be safe than sorry and overreact.
  If one allows a problem to fester for too long, the tumor can turn into something more lethal to society.
</p><p>
  Experiments have already been done where the audience sits back and allows Genshin to make its own decisions without interference
  (as opposed to giving active feedback or intervention).
  The conclusion is that without external interference, Genshin by default will follow whatever the USA media and propaganda wants it to do.
  And therefore it seems certain people cannot be trusted to make independent decisions on their own without external intervention and consultation.
</p><p>
  Whatever social experiment Genshin is supposed to be or having this private corporation make autonomous decisions for so long,
  this is the inevitable conclusion: all media companies without centralized supervision will by default become a USA lapdog and puppet.
  This is simply the world we live in, one of USA hegemony and a continuance of the Anglo world order.
  As such, weak entities or countries that do not have the power or mechanisms to combat such interference from the USA
  will ultimately decay and become satellite states of the USA as well.

<h1>Cases of corruption in 4.3</h1>

<h2>Easy to predict</h2>
<p>By this point, given how clear the deep-rooted biases and discrimination of certain people are,
  it is easy to guess what will happen in 4.3.
</p><p>
  The artists will put Navia on the cover art of 4.3.
  They put Neuvillette on the cover art of 4.0, 4.1, 4.2.
  They have a primal urge to put wei on the cover art of each version in 4.x 
  to serve the interests of only one group of people while attacking and discriminating against everybody else.
  Liu Wei, we get it. It is completely understandable that you want to put yourself on the cover art of every version.
</p><p>
  But people should not be surprised when spam and repetition negatively affects the evaluation of such versions.
  One or two times is one thing, but repeating things 3, 4, 5+ times becomes spam.
  We are counting the number of times Neuvillette or Navia appears on the cover art.
  The higher this number, the less forgiving we will be when Natlan arrives.
</p><p>
  The artists will put a character they have bias and discrimination against 4th in the 4.3 web events and character fan art contest.
</p><p>
  The storywriters will make a political attack against people they have bias and discrimination against in Navia's story quest.
</p><p>
  The storywriters will make a political attack against people they discriminate against in the 4.3 flagship event quest.
</p><p>
  For any combat event or trial, they will put the characters they hate most in the 4th position
  and put their favorite characters in the 6th or 1st position.
</p><p>
  There are a number of birthdays coming up in December when 4.3 releases,
  including Neuvillette, Layla, Zhongli, Dori, etc.
  On each birthday, the game will make a political attack against their enemies.
  We will be counting the number of birthday attack 'gifts' made in 4.3.
  The higher this number, the more negatively 4.x will be evaluated,
  and the worse 5.x will be evaluated too.
</p>
<p>Moreover, it seems the release of Navia just so conveniently aligns with the release of a certain other video game.
  This instance of politically motivated scheduling will result in a penalty of the rating of 4.x as a whole.
</p>

<p>
  On one hand, the number of mistakes and political attacks made in 4.x is bad for the evalustion of 4.x versions,
  but on the other hand, it gives people more dirt that can be used against 5.x Natlan.
</p>
<p>
  The more corrupt people choose to be in 4.x, the less forgiving we will be when it comes to evaluating Natlan.
</p><p>
  What truly saved 4.x from the 'prophecy' is the choice of voice actors for the Fontaine main cast.
  It would take something more spectacular to save 5.x from impending doom.
</p>

<h2>The cases</h2>
<p>Version 4.3 trailer: position of art director Chiori indicates discrimination from video makers.
  Find people making trailers, inspect them for corruption, find replacements.
  How would they feel if they put Chiori 1st and Xavier or Navia in 4th position instead.
  It's a shame that certain video directors do not have EQ or pay attention to the people around them.
</p><p>
  In the 4.3 SP, the TCG art with Dehya could be improved.
</p>
<p>Title of version 'Roses and Muskets' is repetitive and indicates bias and discrimination based on name.</p>
