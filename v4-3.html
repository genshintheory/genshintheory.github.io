<h1>Cases of discrimination in 4.3</h1>
<p>By this point, given how clear the deep-rooted biases and discrimination of certain people are,
  it is easy to guess what will happen in 4.3.
</p><p>
  The artists will put Navia on the cover art of 4.3.
  They put Neuvillette on the cover art of 4.0, 4.1, 4.2.
  They have a primal urge to put wei on the cover art of each version in 4.x 
  to serve the interests of only one group of people while attacking and discriminating against everybody else.
  We are counting the number of times Neuvillette or Navia appears on the cover art.
  The higher this number, the less forgiving we will be when Natlan arrives.
</p><p>
  The artists will put a character they have bias and discrimination against 4th in the 4.3 web events and character fan art contest.
</p><p>
  The storywriters will make a political attack against people they have bias and discrimination against in Navia's story quest.
</p><p>
  The storywriters will make a political attack against people they discriminate against in the 4.3 flagship event quest.
</p><p>
  For any combat event or trial, they will put the characters they hate most in the 4th position
  and put their favorite characters in the 6th or 1st position.
</p><p>
  On one hand, the number of mistakes and political attacks made in 4.x is bad for the evalustion of 4.x versions,
  but on the other hand, it gives people more dirt that can be used against 5.x Natlan.
</p>
<p>
  The more corrupt people choose to be in 4.x, the less forgiving we will be when it comes to evaluating Natlan.
</p><p>
  What truly saved 4.x from the 'prophecy' is the choice of voice actors for the Fontaine main cast.
  It would take something more spectacular to save 5.x from impending doom.
