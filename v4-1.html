<h1>To the Stars Shining in the Depths</h1>

<h1>QoL</h1>
<p>It appears that the commission system will become more like Star Rail's,
  where other activities (besides daily commissions) can count towards giving the daily rewards (via encounter points).
</p>

<h1>Characters</h1>
<p>It is not often that Genshin plucks the MC from a Final Fantasy game and turns him into the chief justice of Fontaine.
  What an interesting world this is.
</p>

<h1>Rapture</h1>
<p>A new underwater area will be introduced, the Fortress of Meropide, incorporating steampunk and industrial elements.
  Meropide is ruled by Wriothesley and is interestingly outside the jurisdiction of Fontaine.
  But anyways, this is basically Genshin's very own Rapture in Fontaine.
  The Bioshock mania does not get any more real than this.
  Hopefully it will be an interesting area to explore, but first appearances did not disappoint.
</p><p>
  So if Meropide is like Rapture, then will there be an Andrew Ryan?
  No gods, only man.
</p>
<p>The developers explained that the circular nature of the assembly lines
  is to symbolize the repetitive, menial aspect of labor in the prisons.
</p>
<p>Tangent: speaking of prisoners, the British empire sent many of its crooks and convicts to Australia.
  So in a sense, Australia was Britain's 'Meropide'.
  One is also reminded of a line from Hamlet: 'Denmark is a prison'.
  This was completely random, but Wriothesley was apparently a patron of Shakespeare.
</p>


<h1>Bosses</h1>
<p>There is a robo boss (Experimental Field Generator) created by Edwin Eastinghouse.
  It seems to modify gravity and allow the player to jump high like Xiao.
  Hmm, it seems Xiao's 'western education' consisted of learning how to jump high from this robo boss
  as well as learning the hp sacrifice destruction dao that various Fontaine characters follow.
</p><p>
  Other than that, an electro unicorn will also be released as a boss.
</p>


<h1>Weapons</h1>
<p>The name of Noctis' signature weapon does remind one of a certain era in modern history.
  Not everything needs to be spelled out directly, but if this is the intention, then this message has been received.
</p><p>
  All that will be said is that:
  laissez-faire capitalism can lead to the rapid development and economic growth of a nation.
  But it can also lead to rampant corruption, a 'Godfather' era.
  It is inevitable that sooner or later, balancing mechanisms and anti-corruption efforts would be put back in place.
  As they say, imperialism is the extreme form of capitalism.
</p><p>
  This even happened in the USA in 2008, 
  where the rampant expansion of private capital was put in check and became more regulated by the USA government.
  Even the USA is not completely capitalist.
  If all USA companies cared about was making money (and this is what the true capitalists care about), 
  then they would just sell themselves to China given how large the Chinese market is.
  But no, the USA government intervened in its own market and guided it with an iron hand.
