<p>To the Stars Shining in the Depths
</p>

<h1>QoL</h1>
<p>It appears that the commission system will become more like Star Rail's,
  where other activities (besides daily commissions) can count towards giving the daily rewards (via encounter points).
</p>

<h1>Characters</h1>
<p>It is not often that Genshin plucks the MC from a Final Fantasy game and turns him into the chief justice of Fontaine.
  What an interesting world this is.
</p>

<h1>Rapture</h1>
<p>A new underwater area will be introduced, the Fortress of Meropide, incorporating steampunk and industrial elements.
  Meropide is ruled by Wriothesley and is interestingly outside the jurisdiction of Fontaine.
  But anyways, this is basically Genshin's very own Rapture in Fontaine.
  The Bioshock mania does not get any more real than this.
  Hopefully it will be an interesting area to explore, but first appearances did not disappoint.
</p><p>
  So if Meropide is like Rapture, then will there be an Andrew Ryan?
  No gods, only man.
</p>
<p>The developers explained that the circular nature of the assembly lines
  is to symbolize the repetitive, menial aspect of labor in the prisons.
</p>
<p>Tangent: speaking of prisoners, the British empire sent many of its crooks and convicts to Australia.
  So in a sense, Australia was Britain's 'Meropide'.
  One is also reminded of a line from Hamlet: 'Denmark is a prison'.
  This was completely random, but Wriothesley was apparently a patron of Shakespeare.
</p>


<h1>Bosses</h1>
<p>There is a robo boss created by Edwin Eastinghouse.
  It seems to modify gravity and allow the player to jump high like Xiao.
  Hmm, it seems Xiao's 'western education' consisted of learning how to jump high from this robo boss
  as well as learning the hp sacrifice destruction dao that various Fontaine characters follow.
