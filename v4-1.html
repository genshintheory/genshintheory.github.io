<p>To the Stars Shining in the Depths
</p>

<h1>QoL</h1>
<p>It appears that the commission system will become more like Star Rail's,
  where other activities (besides daily commissions) can count towards giving the daily rewards (via encounter points).
</p>

<h1>Characters</h1>
<p>It is not often that Genshin plucks the MC from a Final Fantasy game and turns him into the chief justice of Fontaine.
  What an interesting world this is.
</p>

<h1>Rapture</h1>
<p>A new underwater area will be introduced, the Fortress of Meropide, incorporating steampunk and industrial elements.
  Meropide is ruled by Wriothesley and is interestingly outside the jurisdiction of Fontaine.
  But anyways, this is basically Genshin's very own Rapture in Fontaine.
  The Bioshock mania does not get any more real than this.
  Hopefully it will be an interesting area to explore, but first appearances did not disappoint.
