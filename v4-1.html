<h1>To the Stars Shining in the Depths</h1>

<h1>Characters</h1>
<p>It is not often that Genshin plucks the MC from a Final Fantasy game and turns him into the chief justice of Fontaine.
  What an interesting world this is.
</p>

<h1>Rapture</h1>
<p>A new underwater area will be introduced, the Fortress of Meropide, incorporating steampunk and industrial elements.
  Meropide is ruled by Wriothesley and is interestingly outside the jurisdiction of Fontaine.
  But anyways, this is basically Genshin's very own Rapture in Fontaine.
  The Bioshock mania does not get any more real than this.
  Hopefully it will be an interesting area to explore, but first appearances did not disappoint.
</p><p>
  So if Meropide is like Rapture, then will there be an Andrew Ryan?
  No gods, only man.
</p>
<p>The developers explained that the circular nature of the assembly lines
  is to symbolize the repetitive, menial aspect of labor in the prisons.
</p>
<p>Tangent: speaking of prisoners, the British empire exiled many of its crooks and convicts to Australia.
  So in a sense, Australia was Britain's 'Meropide'.
  One is also reminded of a line from Hamlet: 'Denmark is a prison'.
  This was completely random, but Wriothesley was apparently a patron of Shakespeare.
</p>

<h1>QoL</h1>
<p>It appears that the commission system will become more like Star Rail's,
  where other activities (besides daily commissions) can count towards giving the daily rewards (via encounter points).
  In Genshin, completing events, story quests, opening chests can count towards encounter points.
  Also in the end one still has to visit Katheryne to get the last reward.
  By contrast in Star Rail one can just level up an artifact or use a technique.
  Moreover, the final reward can be accessed from menu without having to teleport.
</p>
<p>Also we can finally switch between different conflicting quests instead of being forced to finish one quest to start another one.</p>


<h1>Bosses</h1>
<p>There is a robo boss (Experimental Field Generator) created by Edwin Eastinghouse.
  It seems to modify gravity (gravity reduction field) and allow the player to jump high like Xiao.
  Hmm, it seems Xiao's 'western education' consisted of learning how to jump high from this robo boss
  as well as learning the hp sacrifice destruction dao that various Fontaine characters follow.
</p><p>
  Other than that, an electro unicorn will also be released as a boss.
</p>

<p>The Experimental Field Generator was originally designed to turn Fontaine into a city in the sky
  so that they could avoid the flood.
  So basically Columbia in Bioshock Infinite?
  It seems Genshin already has Celestia as a city in the sky.
</p>


<h1>Weapons</h1>
<p>The name of Noctis' signature weapon does remind one of a certain era in modern history.
  Not everything needs to be spelled out directly, but if this is the intention, then this message has been received.
</p><p>
  All that will be said is that:
  laissez-faire capitalism can lead to the rapid development and economic growth of a nation.
  But it can also lead to rampant corruption, a 'Godfather' era.
  It is inevitable that sooner or later, balancing mechanisms and anti-corruption efforts would be put back in place.
  As they say, imperialism is the extreme form of capitalism.
</p><p>
  This even happened in the USA in 2008, 
  where the rampant expansion of private capital was put in check and became more regulated by the USA government.
  Even the USA is not completely capitalist.
  If all USA companies cared about was making money (and this is what the true capitalists care about), 
  then they would just sell themselves to China given how large the Chinese market is.
  But no, the USA government intervened in its own market and guided it with an iron hand.
</p>
<p>
  If one truly admires capitalists, then they should look up to Alexandrina Victoria, 
  the biggest imperialist and capitalist of the past 200 years.
  It is during the Victoria era that British corporations (such as the East India Company) ruled entire countries.
</p>


<h1>AQ</h1>
<p>We travel to Meropide to find whereabouts on Childe.
  Lyney and his siblings have also broke in.
  Wriothesley reveals that the primordial sea waters are rising and are in fact located beneath Meropide.
  Meropide was helped built by Egeria and her followers long ago.
  Inspired by the legend of Remuria and his golden ship,
  Wriothesley is working on building his own ship to save the people from the rising sea waters and global warming.
  If Noctis is the Leviathan, then the story of building a ship and the flood sounds eerily similar to Biblical stories...
