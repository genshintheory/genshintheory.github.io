  <div class="mw-parser-output"><p>Tartaglia (alias Childe, original name Ajax) is the game's premier enabler, who can function both as a DPS and as a support. 
    The duality extends to his own kit, where he can switch between ranged and melee stance with his skill. 
    This duality makes him one of the more versatile units in the game.
</p><p>Being the first character with a 2nd rerun and appearing in Mondstadt, Liyue, and Inazuma, 
    Tartaglia embodies a different kind of universality, an element that exists across the world. 
    In the game's own words, he represents a force with the ambition to 'conquer the world'.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Talents">Talents</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Elemental_Skill">Elemental Skill</span></h3>
<p>Usually one wants to stay in this stance for at most 15 seconds before swapping off, to avoid the cooldown from becoming a year.
</p><p>The skill is unique in that it turns Tartaglia from a ranged to a melee character. With his ascension passive he applies Riptide on CRIT hits, so it is beneficial to invest some CRIT Rate into Tartaglia.
</p><p>C1 reduces the CD of his skill, which allows for more comfortable gameplay, but still one does not want to stay in this stance for more than 15 seconds.
</p><p>C6 enables a DPS Childe by resetting the CD of his skill. However, for a more support/enabler Childe, it is not necessary. Childe will do his job effectively even at C0.
</p><p>Note Tartaglia will not be able to plunge attack while in this stance. (This may be due to the ambiguity in Childe's exact weapon type during this stance. Genshin has said before that Childe's hydro weapons are partly inspired by shashka swords.)
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Elemental_Burst">Elemental Burst</span></h3>
<p>The burst has higher scaling than Hu Tao's burst and has greater flexibility. One can use it in ranged stance to apply riptide, do a 6m AoE blast, and refund 20 energy. One can also use it in melee stance for greater damage, greater AoE (8m radius), and to clear the Riptide status from opponents and even trigger extra Riptide damage.
</p><p>So one can use Childe's burst any time with benefits in either case. By contrast, for Hu Tao, you almost never want to use her burst outside her skill buff (as you lose out on the ATK buff; you usually want to use it near the end of Hu Tao's skill).
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Passive_Talent">Passive Talent</span></h3>
<p>Master of Weaponry is unique in that it increases the level of your own party members' normal attacks by +1. Note it does not work in co-op mode for other players (and thus does not stack).
</p><p>Still the skill can be very useful for supports such as Kazuha who rely on normal attacks (plunging) and even DPS units like Xiao who benefit from the extra level.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Build">Build</span></h2>
<p>The 4-piece Heart of Depth is Childe's BiS.
</p><p>That said, a 2-piece HoD / 2-piece Noblesse is viable for a burst support Childe. A 4-piece Shimenawa is somewhat viable for Childe, but usually not optimal since Childe's burst does a lot of damage.
</p><p>Look for ATK% on the sands, Hydro DMG Bonus on the goblet, and CRIT on the circlet. The best substats are CRIT &gt; ATK &gt; EM. Childe does not need too much ER since his burst can refund 20 energy already.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Weapons">Weapons</span></h2>
<p>For a master of weaponry, there is much to say about Childe's weapons.
</p><p>Tartaglia has 3 top-tier 5 star bows:
</p>
<ol><li>Polar Star: his BiS</li>
<li>Thundering Pulse: a close second for giving a ton of CRIT DMG</li>
<li>Skyward Harp: a very solid third</li></ol>
<p>Other 5 star bows are viable options but pale in comparison to these big three.
</p><p>Tartaglia's best 4 star option is:
</p>
<ol><li>Viridescent Hunt: its grouping ability is a perfect match for Childe's quadratic-scaling riptide. Plus it gives CRIT Rate, which Childe wants to proc Riptide. It is the perfect bow for a more support/enabler Childe.</li></ol>
<p>Other 4 star options are:
</p>
<ul><li>The Rust: it is decent but overrated as Childe's damage is mixed. Childe also relies on charged attacks, riptide, and burst, so the VH and other 5 star bows above are better.</li>
<li>Hamayumi: craftable bow that can boost both Normal and Charged attacks</li>
<li>The Prototype Crescent with the passive activated is solid.</li>
<li>Blackcliff is a decent stat stick.</li>
<li>Alley Hunter</li>
<li>Other support bows like the Stringless, Favonius, Windblume Ode, etc. are ok for a more burst-support Childe, but even then there are better options outlined above. Note the Stringless does not increase all of Childe's skill damage.
<ul><li>The Sacrificial bow does not really work on Childe (the workaround is very gimmicky and for the most part impractical). It does not really mimic a C6 Childe too well.</li></ul></li>
<li>Note: the Compound Bow for physical Childe is a meme but viable in some situations as Childe has pretty high scalings for his bow auto-attacks (second only to Yoimiya).</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Teams">Teams</span></h2>
<ol><li>Childe-Xiangling-Bennett-Kazuha (International Childe): perhaps Childe's best team due to how well each unit synergizes with each other. Childe synergizes exceptionally well with Kazuha's convenient CC and off-field burst, while Kazuha's plunges benefit from Childe passive talent giving +1 level to normal attacks.
<ul><li>Childe is also arguably Xiangling's best Hydro support, better than Xingqiu.</li></ul></li>
<li>Childe-Xiangling-Bennett-Sucrose (classic vape Childe): one advantage Sucrose has over Kazuha is that she can run Thrilling Tales to snapshot an ATK buff into Xiangling's Pyronado (which requires a bit more work for rotating between party members). Kazuha is usually a more convenient CC unit and easier to use for the vape team, but Sucrose is still an excellent top-tier replacement.</li>
<li>Childe-Beidou-Fischl-Bennett (Fireworks)</li>
<li>Childe-Beidou-Raiden-Bennett (Fireworks with Raiden): this team could have been super amazing, but is hampered by the anti-synergy between Beidou and Raiden (with Beidou's burst discharges not procing on Raiden's burst stance attacks). That said, it is still a solid and fun team.</li></ol>
<p>Note one can use Venti in lieu of Kazuha or Sucrose, but usually the CC Venti provides is overkill, and Childe may sometimes not be able to hit enemies trapped in Venti's burst while in melee stance. For this reason, Kazuha and Sucrose are usually preferred, while Venti can be used in the other Abyss team.
</p><p>These other teams are more for fun or exploration, but are also viable in Abyss:
</p>
<ul><li>Xiao-Childe-Bennett-Venti</li>
<li>Childe-Yoimiya-Bennett (with the last spot being flex: Anemo unit, Xiangling, Beidou, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 id="Calculations">Calculations</h2>
    <p>We assume level 10 E on Childe at level 90 with 4 piece HoD and a Hydro DMG goblet 
      (for a total DMG Bonus of \(28.8+61.6+30=120.4%\) 
      for normal/charged attacks during melee stance). 
    </p><p>
      For now, we ignore other buffs such as VV or Bennett, and we assume no burst for Childe and ignore Riptide 
      (though with these factors, the team will do more damage). 
      Because Childe applies hydro too fast, most of the time he will not be vaporizing his normal attacks.
    </p><p>
      We assume he does a 6 hit combo (N6) with no charged attack (note that depending on the weapon, 
      other combos involving mixing in a charged attack can be more optimal, 
      but will not differ too drastically in application). 
      The total scaling for the 6 hit combo is 642.77 at level 10. 
      The damage scaling for this combo is then
      $$z_C = (1+1.204)*642.77 = 1416.66508$$
      We assume he can do this around 4 times within 15 seconds.
      The cooldown will be \(15+6=21\) seconds.
      The DPS is
      $$x = 4z_C/21 \approx 269.84$$
      Childe's main role is as an enabler.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Trivia">Trivia</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Tartaglia's name in Chinese is 达达利亚 where the first two characters 达达 represent something particularly special in China's history and symbolic of Tartaglia himself. 
    Depending on the time and place, Tartaglia can even be said to represent an alternate side of China, especially the type of China during the Yuan and Qing dynasties.
<ul><li>A Persian historian once wrote that the Mongol emperor Chenggis Khan (the universal ruler) had red/orange hair and blue eyes. Tartaglia also has orange hair and blue eyes. Some people who live in parts of China's north and west actually do have these characteristics, and they may still be ethnically Han.</li>
<li>Tartaglia himself plays a big role in the story of Liyue. Even though he is the main antagonist in that archon quest, he is also made a playable character with his own story quest. There are multiple sides to Tartaglia, a duality.</li></ul></li>
<li>Tartaglia's Hydro vision aligns with his blue eyes but also signifies a kind of connection to the western nation of Fontaine. Moreover, as Rhodeia says, water can take on many shapes and as long as rivers flow, water will exist forever. The Hydro element is symbolic of what Tartaglia represents in relation to Liyue, a kind of element that has existed throughout the ages, taking on various forms in history.</li>
<li>In a game titled 原神 <i>Yuanshen</i>, there could be a symbolic reason why in the Genshin Liyue poster, Tartaglia is at the top.</li>
  <li>It is funny how some American idiots have no idea about the history of Tataria.
    This whole time they thought this guy was just some Ed Sheeran or some Marco Polo (he very well could be)
    when in reality this represents the type of warrior behind the rise of the greatest land empire in history.
