<title>Focalors</title>

  </head>
  
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>


  <h2>The Roosevelts</h2>
  <p>Focalors (芙卡洛斯) is almost an anagram of Roosevelt (罗斯福).
    Nahida shares the same birthday as Theodore Roosevelt.
    So are we supposed to think of Nahida and Focalors as cousins?
    Focalors is not much older than Nahida.
    If Nahida is a child, then Focalors is like what? 
    A teenager going through puberty?
  </p><p>
    Anyways, many American historians would consider the Roosevelts (both FDR and TR) among the greatest American presidents in history.
    TR was known for his 'big stick' policy and imperialism in Central and South America 
    after the USA won the Spanish war and gained Philippines and Cuba as new colonies.
    After nearly half a century of post Civil War, reconstruction, the Gilded Age, and the robber-baron era,
    the victory in the Spanish war signalled the rise of a new naval power in the world: the USA.
  </p><p>
    And thus, the USA's position as a preeminent naval power in the 1900s
    tends to align with Focalor's status as the archon of Fontaine, the nation of water.
  </p><p>
    What did FDR accomplish? He served 4 terms as USA president, which was unprecedented.
    He led the USA through the Great Depression, introduced the New Deal and alphabet soup policies (similar to socialism),
    but perhaps most importantly led the USA through World War 2.
    During WW2, the USA began work on the Manhattan project, directed by Robert Oppenheimer,
    leading to the creation of the atomic bomb.
  </p><p>
    WW1 was known for trench warfare and signalled the end of naval dominated wars.
    WW2 saw the shift to modern aerial warfare, where aircraft and airforce grew in importance in war.
    Nowadays, the navy is still quite important for patrolling the seas and chokepoints such as the Malacca strait.
    However, the introduction of aircrafts has added a new dimension to war.
  </p><p>
    Anyways, in the 1900s, the USA has emerged as the top naval superpower of the world: the 'hydro archon'.
    But who took the crown as the ruler of the seas before the USA?
    In the 1800s, the leading naval superpower of the world was the British Empire, the USA's 'big daddy'.
    And just like how the Roosevelts of the USA have a connection to the name of Focalors,
    so does a queen of the British Empire have a connection to the name of Furina.
  </p>


  <h2>Queen Alexandrina Victoria as the most powerful 'rina' in history</h2>
  <p>Just like how Morax sounds more pleasing to the ear (and actually sounds like the name of a god), so does Focalors.
    That said, the 'rin' in Furina may as well just be a random sound without much meaning.
    But perhaps the most powerful person in history with 'rin' in their name 
    is Alexandrina Victoria, ruler of the British empire during its golden age, 
    the only other empire in history that could rival the Mongol empire in territory.
  </p><p>
    Actually one can be even more specific and claim that
    Alexandrina is the most powerful person in history with 'rina' in their name.
  </p><p>
    But whereas the Mongols had near absolute hegemony and virtually no competitors,
    the British always had to compete with other empires, such as their fellow European empires, the Russians, the Americans, etc.
    The world under Pax Britannica was not one of unity like that of Pax Mongolica,
    but one of division and competition, war and scrambles across continents.
    The majority of global power was not monopolized by one empire, but separated across several different empires.
    So in this sense, the British empire had far less relative power compared to the rest of the world 
    than the Mongol empire (who had a larger portion of world power at the time).
  </p>

  <h3>The Alexandrina era</h3>
  <p>The Victoria era is named after Alexandrina Victoria.
    Also a note on the naming of British monarchs:
    it is a bit different from surnames.
    Alexandrina is actually inherited from her godfather's side, while Victoria is from her mother's side.
    So if anything, Alexandrina is actually closer to the surname.
    So on this site, we may use the term Alexandrina era in lieu of Victoria era (using the terms interchangably).
  </p><p>
    Growing up, she was given the nickname 'Drina' by her family.
  </p><p>
    Alexandrina descended from Edward and Charlotte.
    Specifically, her father was Prince Edward.
    Prince Edward was the son of Charlotte.
    Edward also had a niece called Princess Charlotte.
    When Princess Charlotte passed away in 1817 it prompted a succession crisis.
    Edward married Princess Victoria of Germany.
    Victoria's brother was Leopold, who was the husband of Princess Charlotte (Edward's niece) and also king of Belgium.
  </p><p>
    In 1818, Alexandrina was baptised by Charles Manners-Sutton.
    She was named Alexandrina after her godfather Tsar Alexander I of Russia.
    Apparently, the Tsar Alexander allowed the British to name her after him as a courtesy
    after the British and Russia defeated Napoleon together.
  </p><p>
    Alexandrina also flirted with Alexander II of Russia.
    They danced and conversed in French with each other.
    Ultimately, Alexandrina married Prince Albert.
  </p><p>
    But despite this, the British and Russians were intense rivals (enemies) that did not always see eye to eye.
    The British and French sided with the Ottoman Turks against the Russians in the Crimean War.
    The British and Russians also competed in the Great Game across Eurasia, vying for influence in Afghanistan and Persia.
    The British also backed the Japanese in the Russo-Japanese war.
  </p><p>
    Nonetheless, perhaps the 1800s could indeed be called the Alexandrina era of the world
    as the royal houses of the major European empires were tied together 
    in this Charlotte's web of marriages around Alexandrina.
    It lasted for around a century before Europe erupted into two devestating wars: 
    WW1 and WW2 that saw the end of the colonial era.
  </p>


  <h3>Master of Hong Kong and Singapore</h3>
  <p>Anyone who made a billion dollars while in Hong Kong and Singapore ought to kowtow to Queen Alexandrina.
    During her rule, the British Empire defeated the Qing, took Hong Kong port as a colony, and also ruled over the port of Singapore.
    So Lee Kashing, Lee Kuan Yew, and others who benefited from living in former British colonies
    can bow their heads to their ultimate master who made it possible: Queen Alexandrina.
    And honestly any Ming dynasty sympathizer including the entire house of Zhu 
    ought to worship Alexandrina as a goddess, the true hydro archon, for defeating the Qing.
  </p><p>
    So if Alexandrina is the empress and boss of the workshop, then these colonies are like staff workers whose salaries depend on her.
    But why limit it to a few specks of dust in the southeast:
    all of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and continents came under the rule of Alexandrina.
  </p><p>
    So who is the most powerful ruler in Singapore's history? It is not Lee Kuan Yew. It is Alexandrina Victoria.
    Who is the most powerful person in Hong Kong's history? It is not Li Kashing. It is Alexandrina Victoria.
    When her majesty defeated the Qing in the Opium Wars, she appointed Charles Elliot as first administrator of Hong Kong.
    Li Kashing and Lee Kuan Yew would not even be qualified to polish Queen Victoria's shoes.
    She and the Brits ruled and created these colonies in the first place.
  </p><p>
    Next time you visit Hong Kong or Singapore, see if you can find the statues of Queen Alexandrina Victoria
    or the several schools and buildings named after her.
    These are a testament to her legacy and a reminder of the powerhouse that swept through these places not too long ago.
    Notice how many Singapore leaders continue to go to their daddy Britain to get educated.
    Everyone living in Singapore is living in the shadow of Alexandrina Victoria.
    If Alexandrina viewed the world as a ball in the palm of her hand, then Singapore would just be a speck of dust.
  </p><p>
    Whenever you accept bribes and money from Hong Kong or Singapore,
    you are essentially putting yourself under Alexandrina Victoria, living on her payroll, and continuing to serve her legacy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Who else who made it big in Hong Kong may want to pay their respects to the Queen Alexandrina?
    Perhaps many famous Hong Kong actors such as Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, Andy Lau, etc.
  </p>

  <h3>Alexandrina Victoria as the most powerful wei/vi of all time</h3>
  <p>Victoria is written 维多利亚 Weiduoliya in Chinese.
    This makes her the most powerful 'wei' in Chinese history (and also world history).
    Everybody named wei ought to bow down to Alexandrina and worship her as a goddess for elevating the prestige of the wei name to new heights.
    When you serve the interests of wei, you are putting yourself under Alexandrina Victoria and further promoting her legacy.
    This is called win-win diplomacy.
  </p><p>
    It seems too big of a coincidence that various Fontaine characters
    are taking different parts of Alexandrina Victoria's name such as 'rin', 'vi', etc.
  </p>

  <h3>Alexandrina Victoria: Savior of the Ming and Zhu?</h3>
  <p>If Aisin Gioro defeated Zhu, then who defeated Aisin?
    It seems history has given us an answer: Queen Alexandrina defeated Aisin in the Opium Wars.
    Every Zhu, pig, and Ming dynasty sympathizer in the world ought to have a portrait of her royal majesty Alexandrina in their homes
    and bow down and worship her as their hero and savior for liberating them from the rule of the Qing.
    But does this make Alexandrina a Zhu?
    No. She is much better and more powerful than the House of Zhu and the Ming dynasty.
    The British empire had a far larger impact and reach in global history.
  </p><p>
    There are many political implications of Alexandrina being ruler of the British empire and defeating the Qing,
    especially for a civilization with a history as long as China's.
    Alexandrina essentially prompted a succession of power and transition within China from the Qing rule to the modern era of China.
    Generally speaking, any figure in Chinese history responsible for the succession of dynasties or empires will turn out to be a big name.
    Any comprehensive history of the Qing dynasty and modern Chinese history will have to discuss Queen Alexandrina, the British empire,
    and the implications of the Opium Wars.
  </p>


  <h3>Alexandrina Victoria: Liberator of the Han Chinese people?</h3>
  <p>As controversial as imperialism and the Opium Wars are,
    there is one other important effect Alexandrina had on China:
    she helped end the rule of the Manchu people and bring the Han Chinese people back to power.
    If it were not for Alexandrina declaring war on the Qing, perhaps 1.4 billion Chinese people would still be ruled by Aisin Gioro and the Manchus.
    Is this something you want?
    So perhaps in this sense, Alexandrina ironically becomes a friend and savior of the Han Chinese people.
  </p>

  <h3>One of the most powerful female rulers in history</h3>
  <p>March 7th often talks about girl power.
    Alexandrina Victoria is the ultimate girl power.
    As ruler of the British empire at its peak, she is one of the most powerful ladies (if not the most powerful lady) in history.
  </p><p>
    When it comes to powerful female rulers in Chinese history, one usually thinks about Empress Cixi or Wu Zetian.
    We can add one more person to this list:
    Alexandrina can also count as a 'Chinese ruler', having ruled over Hong Kong, a part of China.
    Anything that was part of China or ruled over part of China in history counts as Chinese history:
    so this includes non-Han people such as Aisin-Gioro and the Mongols,
    as well as various nomadic 'ethnic minorities' such as the Xiongnu and Gokturks.
    In this way, Alexandrina this British lady becomes part of Chinese history too.
    And continuing along this line, she is one of the most powerful female rulers in Chinese history.
  </p><p>
    So if Alexandrina is a Chinese empress, then who is her successor?
    Who founded the political party that now rules China? Perhaps that give you an idea of who her successor is.
    Genshin seems to be playing games with characters like Cyno, Lyney, Furina 
    and support the idea that Fontaine played a role in the modern history of China.
    In this context, Alexandrina is a figure that does loom large over these people,
    as the Opium Wars ultimately set in motion the process that led to the foundation of the modern Chinese nation.
  </p>

  <h3>Alexandrina's greatest legacy is the English language</h3>
  <p>English is the lingua franca of the world,
    learned by billions across all continents from China, India, Africa, etc.
    Alexandrina Victoria is the one who helped make this possible, who made English a global language.
    During Alexandrina's reign, the British empire ruled over six continents, 
    bringing English to Asia, Africa, Australasia, the Americas, etc.
    It was the empire where the sun never set.
  </p><p>
    And to this day, we still live in Alexandrina era.
    English continues to serve as a universal language of the world.
    And this is bolstered by the USA empire, media, and military.
    The USA is the successor of the British empire in the Anglo tradition.
    The USA is continuing to serve the legacy of Queen Alexandrina and the British empire
    by spreading the influence of the English language around the world.
    So you essentially enter a paradox: the after-effects and influence of the Alexandrina Victoria era will not end 
    as long as the USA is still a dominant superpower of the world.
    And unless the USA wants to end its global hegemony, we will continue to live in the Alexandrina era for the foreseeable future.
  </p>

  <h3>Most powerful ruler of past 200 years</h3>
  <p>
    most people think alex greek
    fewer know that another alex most powerful ruler past 200 years
  </p>
  <p>
    ladies and gentlemen, take moment give big round of applause to russia for giving such a name to her royal majesty
    the tsar must be proud knowing that one of his daughters became britain's most powerful ruler in history
  </p>


  <h2>Fu Manchu and the history of USA-China relations</h2>
  <p>The Fu sound does have some cultural legacy in the USA via Fu Manchu.
    This involves the relationship between the USA and China.
    This started 200 years ago, when Chinese immigrants from the Qing dynasty moved to the USA
    and helped build the first transcontinental railway of the Americas.
    The USA then passed the Chinese Exclusion Act.
    Near the end of the Qing dynasty, the Boxer Rebellion happened,
    and the USA was involved diplomatically with the Eight Nation Alliance,
    initiating the 'Open Door Policy' for privileges in trading with China.
  </p><p>
    After the collapse of the Qing, the Chinese and Americans fought in WW2 together.
    Mao Zedong then rose to power and battled the USA in the Korean War and Vietnam War.
    Richard Nixon then initiated a detente with China.
    Some time later, China's economy rapidly developed under the economic reform and opening up (改革开放) during the Deng Xiaoping era.
    China also joined the WTO, becoming a driver of the global economy.
  </p><p>
    So China and the USA have an interesting history of twists and turns.
    Some say the USA-China relationship is the most important geopolitical relationship of the modern era.
  </p><p>
    But why is this important? Genshin is just a video game.
    Various elements of Fontaine appear to be based on the USA and western culture.
    Genshin is a game created in China.
    So how version 4 and Fontaine turns out does have some bearing on the nature of the USA-China relationship
    (and by extension the China-British relationship, China-France relationship).
    So it would be interesting to watch and see how Genshin chooses to handle this.
