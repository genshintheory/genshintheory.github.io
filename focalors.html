  <p>Just like how Morax sounds more pleasing to the ear (and actually sounds like the name of a god), so does Focalors.
    That said, the 'rin' in Furina may as well just be a random sound without much meaning.
    But perhaps the most powerful person in history with 'rin' in their name 
    is Alexandrina Victoria, ruler of the British empire during its golden age, 
    the only other empire in history that could rival the Mongol empire in territory.
  </p><p>
    Actually one can be even more specific and claim that
    Alexandrina is the most powerful person in history with 'rina' in their name.

    But whereas the Mongols had near absolute hegemony and virtually no competitors,
    the British always had to compete with other empires, such as their fellow European empires, the Russians, the Americans, etc.
    The world under Pax Britannica was not one of unity like that of Pax Mongolica,
    but one of division and competition, war and scrambles across continents.
    The majority of global power was not monopolized by one empire, but separated across several different empires.
    So in this sense, the British empire had far less relative power compared to the rest of the world 
    than the Mongol empire (who had a larger portion of world power at the time).
  </p>
  <p>For reference, the Victoria era is named after Alexandrina Victoria.
    Also a note on the naming of British monarchs:
    it is a bit different from surnames.
    Alexandrina is actually inherited from her father's side, while Victoria is from her mother's side.
    So if anything, Alexandrina is actually closer to the surname.
    So on this site, we may use the term Alexandrina era in lieu of Victoria era (using the terms interchangably).
