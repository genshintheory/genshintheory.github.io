<title>Focalors</title>

<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>


  <h2>The Roosevelts</h2>
  <p>Focalors (芙卡洛斯) is almost an anagram of Roosevelt (罗斯福).
    Nahida shares the same birthday as Theodore Roosevelt.
    So are we supposed to think of Nahida and Focalors as cousins?
    Focalors is not much older than Nahida.
    If Nahida is a child, then Focalors is like what? 
    A teenager going through puberty?
  </p><p>
    Anyways, many American historians would consider the Roosevelts (both FDR and TR) among the greatest American presidents in history.
    TR was known for his 'big stick' policy and imperialism in Central and South America 
    after the USA won the Spanish war and gained Philippines and Cuba as new colonies.
    After nearly half a century of post Civil War, reconstruction, the Gilded Age, and the robber-baron era,
    the victory in the Spanish war signalled the rise of a new naval power in the world: the USA.
  </p><p>
    And thus, the USA's position as a preeminent naval power in the 1900s
    tends to align with Focalor's status as the archon of Fontaine, the nation of water.
  </p><p>
    What did FDR accomplish? He served 4 terms as USA president, which was unprecedented.
    He led the USA through the Great Depression, introduced the New Deal and alphabet soup policies (similar to socialism),
    but perhaps most importantly led the USA through World War 2.
    During WW2, the USA began work on the Manhattan project, directed by Robert Oppenheimer,
    leading to the creation of the atomic bomb.
  </p><p>
    WW1 was known for trench warfare and signalled the end of naval dominated wars.
    WW2 saw the shift to modern aerial warfare, where aircraft and airforce grew in importance in war.
    Nowadays, the navy is still quite important for patrolling the seas and chokepoints such as the Malacca strait.
    However, the introduction of aircrafts has added a new dimension to war.
  </p><p>
    Anyways, in the 1900s, the USA has emerged as the top naval superpower of the world: the 'hydro archon'.
    But who took the crown as the ruler of the seas before the USA?
    In the 1800s, the leading naval superpower of the world was the British Empire, the USA's 'big daddy'.
    And just like how the Roosevelts of the USA have a connection to the name of Focalors,
    so does a queen of the British Empire have a connection to the name of Furina.
  </p>


  <h2>Queen Alexandrina Victoria as the most powerful 'rina' in history</h2>
  <p>Just like how Morax sounds more pleasing to the ear (and actually sounds like the name of a god), so does Focalors.
    That said, the 'rin' in Furina may as well just be a random sound without much meaning.
    But perhaps the most powerful person in history with 'rin' in their name 
    is Alexandrina Victoria, ruler of the British empire during its golden age, 
    the only other empire in history that could rival the Mongol empire in territory.
  </p><p>
    Actually one can be even more specific and claim that
    Alexandrina is the most powerful person in history with 'rina' in their name.
  </p><p>
    But whereas the Mongols had near absolute hegemony and virtually no competitors,
    the British always had to compete with other empires, such as their fellow European empires, the Russians, the Americans, etc.
    The world under Pax Britannica was not one of unity like that of Pax Mongolica,
    but one of division and competition, war and scrambles across continents.
    The majority of global power was not monopolized by one empire, but separated across several different empires.
    So in this sense, the British empire had far less relative power compared to the rest of the world 
    than the Mongol empire (who had a larger portion of world power at the time).
  </p>

  <h3>The Alexandrina era</h3>
  <p>The Victoria era is named after Alexandrina Victoria.
    Also a note on the naming of British monarchs:
    it is a bit different from surnames.
    Alexandrina is actually inherited from her godfather's side, while Victoria is from her mother's side.
    So if anything, Alexandrina is actually closer to the surname.
    So on this site, we may use the term Alexandrina era in lieu of Victoria era (using the terms interchangably).
  </p><p>
    Growing up, she was given the nickname 'Drina' by her family.
  </p><p>
    Alexandrina descended from Edward and Charlotte.
    Specifically, her father was Prince Edward.
    Prince Edward was the son of Charlotte.
    Edward also had a niece called Princess Charlotte.
    When Princess Charlotte passed away in 1817 it prompted a succession crisis.
    Edward married Princess Victoria of Germany.
    Victoria's brother was Leopold, who was the husband of Princess Charlotte (Edward's niece) and also king of Belgium.
  </p><p>
    In 1818, Alexandrina was baptised by Charles Manners-Sutton.
    She was named Alexandrina after her godfather Tsar Alexander I of Russia.
    Apparently, the Tsar Alexander allowed the British to name her after him as a courtesy
    after the British and Russia defeated Napoleon together.
  </p><p>
    Alexandrina also flirted with Alexander II of Russia.
    They danced and conversed in French with each other.
    Ultimately, Alexandrina married Prince Albert.
  </p><p>
    But despite this, the British and Russians were intense rivals (enemies) that did not always see eye to eye.
    The British and French sided with the Ottoman Turks against the Russians in the Crimean War.
    The British and Russians also competed in the Great Game across Eurasia, vying for influence in Afghanistan and Persia.
    The British also backed the Japanese in the Russo-Japanese war.
  </p><p>
    Nonetheless, perhaps the 1800s could indeed be called the Alexandrina era of the world
    as the royal houses of the major European empires were tied together 
    in this Charlotte's web of marriages around Alexandrina.
    It lasted for around a century before Europe erupted into two devestating wars: 
    WW1 and WW2 that saw the end of the colonial era.
  </p>

  

  <h3>Master of Hong Kong and Singapore</h3>
  <p>Anyone who made a billion dollars while in Hong Kong and Singapore ought to kowtow to Queen Alexandrina.
    During her rule, the British Empire defeated the Qing, took Hong Kong port as a colony, and also ruled over the port of Singapore.
    So Lee Kashing, Lee Kuan Yew, and others who benefited from living in former British colonies
    can bow their heads to their ultimate master who made it possible: Queen Alexandrina.
    And honestly any Ming dynasty sympathizer including the entire house of Zhu 
    ought to worship Alexandrina as a goddess, the true hydro archon, for defeating the Qing.
  </p><p>
    So if Alexandrina is the empress and boss of the workshop, then these colonies are like staff workers whose salaries depend on her.
    But why limit it to a few specks of dust in the southeast:
    all of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and continents came under the rule of Alexandrina.
  </p>





  <h2>Fu Manchu and the history of USA-China relations</h2>
  <p>The Fu sound does have some cultural legacy in the USA via Fu Manchu.
    This involves the relationship between the USA and China.
    This started 200 years ago, when Chinese immigrants from the Qing dynasty moved to the USA
    and helped build the first transcontinental railway of the Americas.
    The USA then passed the Chinese Exclusion Act.
    Near the end of the Qing dynasty, the Boxer Rebellion happened,
    and the USA was involved diplomatically with the Eight Nation Alliance,
    initiating the 'Open Door Policy' for privileges in trading with China.
  </p><p>
    After the collapse of the Qing, the Chinese and Americans fought in WW2 together.
    Mao Zedong then rose to power and battled the USA in the Korean War and Vietnam War.
    Richard Nixon then initiated a detente with China.
    Some time later, China's economy rapidly developed under the economic reform and opening up (改革开放) during the Deng Xiaoping era.
    China also joined the WTO, becoming a driver of the global economy.
  </p><p>
    So China and the USA have an interesting history of twists and turns.
    Some say the USA-China relationship is the most important geopolitical relationship of the modern era.
  </p><p>
    But why is this important? Genshin is just a video game.
    Various elements of Fontaine appear to be based on the USA and western culture.
    Genshin is a game created in China.
    So how version 4 and Fontaine turns out does have some bearing on the nature of the USA-China relationship
    (and by extension the China-British relationship, China-France relationship).
    So it would be interesting to watch and see how Genshin chooses to handle this.
