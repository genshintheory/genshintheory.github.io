<title>Plunging</title>

  <p>Plunge dps started with Xiao.
    In the early days, plunging was restricted to a few characters,
    dragonstrike Diluc, then Kazuha.
    But now 4.4 has brought plunging to the masses.
  </p>
  <p>Similar to how hyperbloom gives a rookie friendly way to clear abyss (easy access to high dps),
    so does plunging dps with Bennett C6, XY, Furina.
    Now even Yun Jin can be a plunge master.
  </p><p>
    Note not every character may benefit from plunging (e.g. bows, some catalysts), so we generally focus on melee dps (sword, claymore, polearm).
    And some characters with infusions that cannot be overriden (like Xiaogan geo infusion after E) 
    may not be able to infuse pyro with Bennett C6.
    Moreover, claymores (which have larger hitboxes) may be able to benefit more from collision damage.
    Certain characters with higher plunge multipliers (Diluc, Xiao) may capitalize more from plunge dps than others.
    Destruction characters that can manipulate hp may also synergize better with Furina.
    And the character should synergize with healers too (for XY healing).
    Being pyro could also help with Bennett synergy, pyro resonance (which benefits XY), vape, vv, etc.
    Besides anemo (Xiao), autumn dps (pyro/cryo/electro/hydro) will also benefit from XY's 16s of vv app (can be 16+ seconds due to vv lasting for several seconds).
  </p><p>
    As XY can be the vv character, it may be redundant to put XY and Kazuha on the same team.
    In the end it boils down to: does one want plunge buff from XY or dmg bonus from Kazuha (as both provide vv)?
    And if one chooses XY, is Kazuha's dmg bonus buff large enough to compensate for not using Bennett or Furina?
    The reason why Furina is used (besides enabling vape for plunges without needing NA unlike Yelan/XQ)
    is because her Q also provides an insane amount of dmg bonus, which can be substituted for Kazuha's harmony buff.
    So one can use Kazuha on the other abyss team.
  </p>

  <p>So what is the baseline dps one can achieve with a Bennett C6, XY, Furina team?
    Suppose the high plunge multiplier
