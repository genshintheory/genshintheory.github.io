<title>Plunging</title>

  </head>

  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  <p>Plunge dps started with Xiao.
    In the early days, plunging was restricted to a few characters,
    dragonstrike Diluc, then Kazuha.
    But now 4.4 has brought plunging to the masses.
  </p>
  <p>Similar to how hyperbloom gives a rookie friendly way to clear abyss (easy access to high dps),
    so does plunging dps with Bennett C6, XY, Furina.
    Now even Yun Jin can be a plunge master.
  </p><p>
    Note not every character may benefit from plunging (e.g. bows, some catalysts), so we generally focus on melee dps (sword, claymore, polearm).
    And some characters with infusions that cannot be overriden (like Xiaogan geo infusion after E) 
    may not be able to infuse pyro with Bennett C6.
    Moreover, claymores (which have larger hitboxes) may be able to benefit more from collision damage.
    Certain characters with higher plunge multipliers (Diluc, Xiao) may capitalize more from plunge dps than others.
    Destruction characters that can manipulate hp may also synergize better with Furina.
    Being pyro could also help with Bennett synergy, pyro resonance (which benefits XY), vape, etc.
  </p>

  <p>So what is the baseline dps one can achieve with a Bennett C6, XY, Furina team?
