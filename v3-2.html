<h2>Banners</h2>
<p>First half: Nahida + Yoimiya</p>
<p>Second half: Yae + Childe + Layla</p>

<p>Yoimiya had always been put between a rock and a tight place.
  Her first banner was right before the electro archon Raiden Shogun's banner.
  And her rerun was right before Sumeru.
  Moreover on her rerun, Yoimiya was put alone with no new characters,
  while Kazuha, Klee, and Heizou were put together on the first half (ouch).
  In addition, the USA shills, FBI, and their proxies launch countless smear campaigns against Yoimiya.
</p><p>
  Putting Yoimiya with Nahida signals that the community realizes their past mistakes 
  and are starting to atone for their past sins.
