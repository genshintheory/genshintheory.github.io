<h2>Banners</h2>
<p>First half: Nahida + Yoimiya</p>
<p>Second half: Yae + Childe + Layla</p>

<p>Yoimiya had always been put between a rock and a tight place.
  Her first banner was right before the electro archon Raiden Shogun's banner.
  And her rerun was right before Sumeru.
  Moreover on her rerun, Yoimiya was put alone with no new characters,
  while Kazuha, Klee, and Heizou were put together on the first half (ouch).
  In addition, the USA shills, FBI, and their proxies launch countless smear campaigns against Yoimiya.
</p><p>
  Putting Yoimiya with Nahida signals that the community realizes their past mistakes 
  and are starting to atone for their past sins.
</p>


<h2>Story</h2>
<p>We free Nahida, defeat Scaramouche, learn that Dottore has clones, 
cleanse the Irminsul (which causes the world to forget Rukkhadevata's existence),
and learn that the traveler is the 4th descender of Teyvat
(and that their sibling is not a 'descender').
The 1st descender is referred to as the 'Heavenly Principles'.
We also learn the Ars Goetia name of the hydro/justice/Fontaine archon, Focalor.
</p>
<p>Whoever came up with the names for the 3.2 archon quests and Nahida's story quest 
  must have been raging or malding hard.
</p><p>
  The Scaramouche boss' epithet (Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom 七叶寂照秘密主 qiye jizhao mimi zhu)
  is a combination of all the things that people hate in the world.
  It combines all the hypocrisy from history.
  The music slaps hard too.
  Besides Azhdaha, it is perhaps safe to say that Scaramouche is the best designed boss to date.
</p>
<p>
  In Nahida's quest, beating up Emira is revenge for all the crimes Emi committed.
