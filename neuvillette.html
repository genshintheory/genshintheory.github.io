<p>It is certainly interesting to have Noctis enter the world of Teyvat as if it were an isekai.
</p><p>
  Interestingly, Noctis became the chief justice of Fontaine.
  With all due respect, this person is probably more suited to be a banker managing Fontaine's cashflows than a justice.
  It seems the banker turned into a judge and politician.
  But as they say: money is power.
  So who knows if the banks secretly control all the courts and politicians in the world.
</p>

<p>'I will have order'. 
  This line from Morax fits Noctis quite well too.
  He may as well use his cane as a weapon to bring order to the courtroom.
  In his elemental burst, he throws his cane at the enemy, petrifying them.
</p>

<p>The end of Noctis' demo shows a sky cracking like glass.
  Hmm, is this a possible reference to <a href='rene.html'>Rene's world formula prophecy</a> 
  or how Dottore told Nahida that the skies are fake in the Sumeru AQ?
</p>

<h2>The only male Melusine?</h2>
<p>It appears Neuvillette runs his own mafia of Melusines.
  The Melusines also seem to look up to Noctis as a role model kind of figure.
  How cute.
</p>


<h2>The Leviathan</h2>
<p>Neuvillette's character intro contains a reference to the Bible and Leviathan, the <a href='enkanomiya.html'>hydro dragon</a>.
  Perhaps this is foreshadowing?
  Noctis is described to be quite emotionless...
</p>


<h2>Napoleonic code</h2>
<p>Is it even remotely possible that Neuvillette is related to or inspired by Napoleon Bonaparte, the emperor of France?
  After all, Fontaine is based on France.
  Napoleon was known for establishing the Napoleonic code, a civil code still in use in France.
  During this period, Napoleon headed the French Consulate, which is usually considered something very important in French history.
</p><p>
  Similarly, the Iudex Neuvillette is well-versed in the law and civil cases of Fontaine,
  even helping pass laws and amendments himself.
  It appears Napoleon and Neuvillette share a similar connection to the judicial system.
</p><p>
  Napoleon was also the og that tried to invade Russia.
  We all know how that turned out.
  On the topic of hydro and water, Napoleon was also quite famous for the Battle of Waterloo (1815),
  truly one of the campaigns of all time.
</p><p>
  So if Noctis is like Napoleon, then could the electro unicorn pony thing be his Marengo?
  Quite a trusty steed.
</p>

<h2>Kit</h2>
<p>Noctis can use hydro pump.
  It is funny what kinds of analogies some people make for this: Gyarados, Blastoise, Squirtle.
</p>
<p>He will drain his HP to use his special CA.
  So it seems Xiao, Lyney, Noctis are part of a special club of destruction characters that can continuously drain their HP.
</p><p>
  Noctis' E and Q create sourcewater droplets.
  His E creates 3, while his Q creates 6.
  These droplets help him charge his special CA faster.
  Would he be able to absorb the droplets created by the hydro MC?
</p><p>
  Noctis' AoE appears to be pretty good.
