<p>It is certainly interesting to have Noctis enter the world of Teyvat as if it were an isekai.
</p><p>
  Interestingly, Noctis became the chief justice of Fontaine.
  With all due respect, this person is probably more suited to be a banker managing Fontaine's cashflows than a justice.
  It seems the banker turned into a judge and politician.
  But as they say: money is power.
  So who knows if the banks secretly control all the courts and politicians in the world.
