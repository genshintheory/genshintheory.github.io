<p>It is certainly interesting to have Noctis enter the world of Teyvat as if it were an isekai.
</p><p>
  Interestingly, Noctis became the chief justice of Fontaine.
  With all due respect, this person is probably more suited to be a banker managing Fontaine's cashflows than a justice.
  It seems the banker turned into a judge and politician.
  But as they say: money is power.
  So who knows if the banks secretly control all the courts and politicians in the world.
</p>


<h2>The only male Melusine?</h2>
<p>It appears Neuvillette runs his own mafia of Melusines.
  The Melusines also seem to look up to Noctis as a role model kind of figure.
  How cute.
</p>


<h2>The Leviathan</h2>
<p>Neuvillette's character intro contains a reference to the Bible and Leviathan, the hydro dragon.
  Perhaps this is foreshadowing?
  Noctis is described to be quite emotionless...
</p>


<h2>Napoleonic code</h2>
<p>Is it even remotely possible that Neuvillette is related to or inspired by Napoleon Bonaparte, the emperor of France?
  After all, Fontaine is based on France.
  Napoleon was known for establishing the Napoleonic code, a civil code still in use in France.
  During this period, Napoleon headed the French Consulate, which is usually considered something very important in French history.
</p><p>
  Similarly, the Iudex Neuvillette is well-versed in the law and civil cases of Fontaine,
  even helping pass laws and amendments himself.
  It appears Napoleon and Neuvillette share a similar connection to the judicial system.
</p><p>
  Napoleon was also the og that tried to invade Russia.
  We all know how that turned out.
  On the topic of hydro and water, Napoleon was also quite famous for the Battle of Waterloo (1815),
  truly one of the campaigns of all time.
