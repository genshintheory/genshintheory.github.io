<title>Neuvillette</title>

  </head>
  
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>



<p>It is certainly interesting to have Noctis enter the world of Teyvat as if it were an isekai.
</p><p>
  Interestingly, Noctis became the chief justice of Fontaine.
  With all due respect, this person is probably more suited to be a banker managing Fontaine's cashflows than a justice.
  It seems the banker turned into a judge and politician.
  But as they say: money is power.
  So who knows if the banks secretly control all the courts and politicians in the world.
</p>

<p>Noctis and Morax have the same base hp.
  This pretty much confirms a long time suspicion that many people had on what exactly Morax represents.
  And it has a lot to do with money.
  Morax even uses the specific character æ‘© mo.
</p>
<p>'I will have order'. 
  This line from Morax fits Noctis quite well too.
  He may as well use his cane as a weapon to bring order to the courtroom.
  In his elemental burst, he throws his cane at the enemy, petrifying them.
</p>

<p>The end of Noctis' demo shows a sky cracking like glass.
  Hmm, is this a possible reference to <a href='rene.html'>Rene's world formula prophecy</a> 
  or how Dottore told Nahida that the skies are fake in the Sumeru AQ?
</p>

<h2>The only male Melusine?</h2>
<p>It appears Neuvillette runs his own mafia of Melusines.
  The Melusines also seem to look up to Noctis as a role model kind of figure.
  How cute.
</p>


<h2>The Leviathan</h2>
<p>Neuvillette's character intro contains a reference to the Bible and Leviathan, the <a href='enkanomiya.html'>hydro dragon</a>.
  Perhaps this is foreshadowing?
  Noctis is described to be quite emotionless...
</p>


<h2>Napoleonic code</h2>
<p>Is it even remotely possible that Neuvillette is related to or inspired by Napoleon Bonaparte, the emperor of France?
  After all, Fontaine is based on France.
  Napoleon was known for establishing the Napoleonic code, a civil code still in use in France.
  During this period, Napoleon headed the French Consulate, which is usually considered something very important in French history.
</p><p>
  Similarly, the Iudex Neuvillette is well-versed in the law and civil cases of Fontaine,
  even helping pass laws and amendments himself.
  It appears Napoleon and Neuvillette share a similar connection to the judicial system.
</p><p>
  Napoleon was also the og that tried to invade Russia.
  We all know how that turned out.
  On the topic of hydro and water, Napoleon was also quite famous for the Battle of Waterloo (1815),
  truly one of the campaigns of all time.
</p><p>
  So if Noctis is like Napoleon, then could the electro unicorn pony thing be his Marengo?
  Quite a trusty steed.
</p>

<h2>Kit</h2>
<p>Noctis can use hydro pump.
  It is funny what kinds of analogies some people make for this: Gyarados, Blastoise, Squirtle.
</p>
<p>While using his special CA, he will drain his HP.
  So it seems Xiao, Lyney, Noctis are part of a special club of destruction characters that can continuously drain their HP.
</p><p>
  Noctis' E and Q create sourcewater droplets.
  His E creates 3, while his Q creates 6.
  These droplets help him charge his special CA faster.
  Each special CA absorbs 3 droplets at a time.
  He is able to absorb the droplets created by the hydro MC,
  which would make hydro MC a support for Noctis.
</p><p>
  Noctis' AoE appears to be pretty good.
</p>

<p>One passive increases the special CA the more hydro reactions triggered, up to 3 draconic stacks.
  The increase is multiplicative at 110%/125%/160% when 1/2/3 hydro reactions are triggered.
  The 160% increase is big enough that one usually wants to play 4 different elements at C0 (diversity team).
  So Noctis is quite dependent on reactions, basically the opposite of Lyney who prefers mono teams.
  Although this passive seems to allow for more flexibility in team building,
  it can actually turn out to be a restriction of its own kind as double hydro will result in one less stack (at C0).
</p>


<h2>Constellations</h2>
<p>Constellations are overall decent.</p>
<p>
  C1 gives one draconic stack for free, which frees up his team building and enables double hydro teams.
  However, it may still not allow things like triple or quadruple hydro.
  Why would you want 3 or 4 hydro on a team? The purpose is to help Noctis' energy generation.
  Because Xiao and Itto can be freely played in mono teams (not dependent on reaction stacks),
  such teams can generate more anemo or geo particles to funnel their 70 cost bursts.
</p><p>
  C2 gives 14% crit dmg to CA per stack.
  C3 increases CA levels.
  C4 generates a droplet when Noctis is healed (once per 4s).
  C5 increases Q levels.
  C6 allows his CA to absorb more droplets to last longer than 3s (for more continuous CA) 
  and fire off 2 other currents.
</p>


<h2>Build</h2>
<p>
  The 4p marechausse is recommended as Noctis can continuously drain his hp and obtain full stacks easily.
  Alternatively, one can try 4p HoD or 4p Nymph.
  Do HP, Hydro, Crit build.
</p><p>
  The Eternal Flow (Liu Yong) Aeon Wave weapon is his bis.
  Verity, Toledo are ok.
  For 4 star weapons, the Prototype Amber is one of his bis.
  Widsith is also decent.
</p>


<h2>Teams</h2>
<p>Hyperbloom, taser, freeze, vape, 
  burgeon (sautee, curry, oven, who came up with these names?) can work.
  Teammates can include Nahida, Dehya, anemo vv (Venti, Kazuha, Sucrose), Morax, Fischl, Raiden, Yae, Kuki, Yaoyao.
  Although double hydro may not be too recommended unless C1, hydro teammates can include Mona.
  Like Lyney, Noctis is a CA dps that does not use XQ or Yelan.
</p>


<h2>Calculations</h2>
<p>It takes 4s to charge his special ca.
  The ca lasts 3s, hits 8 times, and there is 1s between consecutive ca.
  So a normal rotation is 8s.
  In 18s, he may do 2 full ca without E or Q.
</p><p>
  Assume 61.6% dmg bonus on ca + 30% from passive for 91.6% dmg bonus.
