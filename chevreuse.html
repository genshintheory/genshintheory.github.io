<title>Chevreuse</title>

  <p>Chevreuse was playable as a trial character in the Roses and Muskets event.</p>

  <h1>Ogedei</h1>
  <p>It seems Ogedei (窝阔台汗) is finally getting some screentime in Genshin.
    For years it was thought that Genshin had bias to only certain descendants of Genghis,
    such as Jochi, Kublai, etc.
    But now we can celebrate the other sons of Genghis,
    including the very khan who led the conquests of Europe during the rise of the Mongol Empire and Golden Horde.
    So it is fitting that Chevreuse debuts in Fontaine.
  </p>

  <h1>Chevrolet</h1>
  <p>The Chevy is an American car, and Chevrolet is part of General Motors.
    It was founded by Louis Chevrolet, Arthur Chevrolet in 1911.
  </p>

  <h1>Kit</h1>
  <p>She seems similar to Nilou.
    Similar to how Nilou needs 2-element dendro-hydro teams to buff bloom,
    Chevreuse needs 2-element pyro-electro teams (and overloaded) to buff the team.
    So in this sense, both Nilou and Chevreuse are harmony characters.
    However, Chevreuse's kit is not as restrictive as Nilou.
  </p>

  <h1>Teams</h1>
  <p>She can be played in:
    1) Lyney teams with Kuki, Yae,
    2) Raiden national teams with XL, Bennett.
    3) Yoimiya-Raiden-Bennett teams.
