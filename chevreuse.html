<title>Chevreuse</title>

  </head>
  
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>


  <p>Chevreuse was playable as a trial character in the Roses and Muskets event.</p>

  <h1>Ogedei</h1>
  <p>It seems Ogedei (窝阔台汗) is finally getting some screentime in Genshin.
    For years it was thought that Genshin had bias to only certain descendants of Genghis,
    such as Jochi, Kublai, etc.
    But now we can celebrate the other sons of Genghis,
    including the very khan who led the conquests of Europe during the rise of the Mongol Empire and Golden Horde.
    So it is fitting that Chevreuse debuts in Fontaine.
  </p><p>
    For legal reasons, this is part satire and based on the fact she has 'wo' in her Chinese name.
    But still, we admit that the 'wo' character may be referring to other things in life...
    We believe the doxxers and those with access to too much information may have a vague idea what we are referring to.
  </p>

  <h1>Chevrolet</h1>
  <p>The Chevy is an American car, and Chevrolet is part of General Motors.
    It was founded by Louis Chevrolet, Arthur Chevrolet in 1911.
    And perhaps her pyro-electro design and kit is reminiscent of how combustion engines and motors power cars throughout history.
  </p>

  <h1>Kit</h1>
  <p>At first glance, she looks like overload Nilou.
    Similar to how Nilou needs 2-element dendro-hydro teams to buff bloom,
    Chevreuse needs 2-element pyro-electro teams (and overloaded) to buff the team.
    So in this sense, both Nilou and Chevreuse are harmony characters.
    However, Chevreuse's kit is not as restrictive as Nilou.
  </p><p>
    First, Chevreuse/Nilou's passive is not as restrictive as something like Lyney or Gorou/Itto,
    who want <a href='mono.html'>mono</a>-element teams (3 of same element, where last slot is flex).
    But it is still more restrictive than say Noctis or Xiaogan's passives.
    So they are in a kind of middle ground in terms of team restriction
    (as opposed to characters with more or less 'complete freedom' in team-building such as Xiao, Scaramouche, Wrio, Furina, etc.).
  </p><p>
    Even then, Nilou is almost completely chained to needing only hydro and dendro for her golden chalice passive
    as that gives a big buff to bloom and enables her teams to do more damage.
    On the other hand, the only thing Chevreuse gets from pyro-electro only teams is her passive 40% res shred to pyro and electro.
    Everything else she does she can do outside of such teams, and that res shred is replaceable with anemo vv.
    Even her C6 buffing dmg bonus does not require such a team restriction.
    As such, Chevreuse can be played in many more teams, outside pyro-electro only teams, compared to what Nilou's kit requires.
    The buff Nilou gives to bloom (the bountiful core) is not easily replaceable comparable to res shred.
  </p>

  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>Her E enters rifle aiming mode and fires a shot.
  </p><p>
    Her Q heals based on her HP.
    The more HP she has the more she can buff team atk, up to 40% (needs 40k HP to cap the buff).
    This buff lasts 30s and does not require pyro-electro only teams.
  </p>

  <h2>Build</h2>
  <p>For damage (E nuke): ATK-pyro-crit.
    For support (recommended): either full HP or ER-HP-HP.
    For artifacts: 4p noblesse.
    For weapons: favonius or even black tassel if you want.
  </p>

  <h1>Teams</h1>
  <p>She can be played in:
    1) Lyney teams with Kuki, Yae,
    2) Raiden national teams with XL, Bennett.
    3) Yoimiya-Raiden-Bennett teams.
  </p><p>
    Some theorycrafters say none of these teams would be optimal for dps
    as adding Yelan/XQ/Furina for overvape/vapeload and dendro would be a dps increase.
    One of the few situations where Chevreuse teams can be better than ordinary national teams with hydro subdps,
    is when the enemy has a constant hydro status, like the hydro tulpa/slime (as hydro subdps will not deal damage to a hydro tulpa).
    But even then, against hydro enemies, dendro and hyperbloom go brrr.
  </p><p>
    Others speculate that perhaps Chevreuse is a support for a future dps (like how Gorou is a support for Itto).
    The way this would work is if say an electro dps gains increased scaling when triggering an overload reaction.
    Moreover this electro dps has such high scaling that they would not benefit much from quicken's additive bonus.
    Also the electro dps lacks off-field electro application or does not apply electro frequently to be as competitive as other hyperbloom drivers.
    For such a kit, Chevreuse could be optimal.
    Although Chevreuse can support Cyno, Cyno almost always prefers a dendro support for quickbloom.
  </p>
  <p>For more details, this is just an imagined kit, but vv 40% res shred usually provides a 1.28 times buff in dmg (for enemies with around 10% res).
    Chev can also provide 40% res shred, but in order for her to be more optimal than vv for an electro dps,
    that electro dps needs to get much more significant buffs in scaling from overload.
    So say the electro subdps has 700% scaling on E (similar to Xiaogan's E).
    Quicken additive buff will not give much of a multiplicative increase as this is a big number rather than a small number.
  </p><p>
    So overloaded would have to give much greater scaling for it to be more useful than other reactions.
    For example, each overloaded reaction can give 350% more scaling to E, stacking up to 2 times.
    This is a 1.5-2 times increase in damage from overloaded, which greatly eclipses the buff from vv res shred.
    And in such a case, Chev would be an optimal support for buffing the electro dps.
  </p><p>
    The buff from overload needs to be greater than vv to compensate for the fact that anemo also has grouping whereas overload knocks away light enemies
    (cc decreases entropy, whereas overload knockback increases entropy if you want to talk about thermodynamics and Carnot heat engines).
  </p>


  <h1>Harmony path</h1>
  <p>Reviewing Chevreuse's kit, it seems to make sense to consider Nilou as a harmony support character that buffs the bloom reaction for the team.
    And Nilou can indeed be played as an off-field support in several teams,
    such as for Alhaitham-Nahida-Nilou teams where Alhaitham/Nahida apply dendro really fast to spam bountiful core blooms.
