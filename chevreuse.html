<title>Chevreuse</title>

  <div id="includedContent"></div>


  <p>Chevreuse was playable as a trial character in the Roses and Muskets event.</p>

  <h1>Ogedei</h1>
  <p>It seems Ogedei (窝阔台汗) is finally getting some screentime in Genshin.
    For years it was thought that Genshin had bias to only certain descendants of Genghis,
    such as Jochi, Kublai, etc.
    But now we can celebrate the other sons of Genghis,
    including the very khan who led the conquests of Europe during the rise of the Mongol Empire and Golden Horde.
    So it is fitting that Chevreuse debuts in Fontaine.
  </p>

  <h1>Chevrolet</h1>
  <p>The Chevy is an American car, and Chevrolet is part of General Motors.
    It was founded by Louis Chevrolet, Arthur Chevrolet in 1911.
  </p>

  <h1>Kit</h1>
  <p>She seems similar to Nilou.
    Similar to how Nilou needs 2-element dendro-hydro teams to buff bloom,
    Chevreuse needs 2-element pyro-electro teams (and overloaded) to buff the team.
    So in this sense, both Nilou and Chevreuse are harmony characters.
    However, Chevreuse's kit is not as restrictive as Nilou.
  </p><p>
    First, Chevreuse/Nilou's passive is not as restrictive as something like Lyney or Gorou/Itto,
    who want <a href='mono.html'>mono</a>-element teams (3 of same element, where last slot is flex).
    But it is still more restrictive than say Noctis or Xiaogan's passives.
    So they are in a kind of middle ground in terms of team restriction
    (as opposed to characters with more or less 'complete freedom' in team-building such as Xiao, Scaramouche, Wrio, Furina, etc.).
  </p><p>
    Even then, Nilou is almost completely chained to needing only hydro and dendro for her golden chalice passive
    as that gives a big buff to bloom and enables her teams to do more damage.
    On the other hand, the only thing Chevreuse gets from pyro-electro only teams is her passive 40% res shred to pyro and electro.
    Everything else she does she can do outside of such teams.
    Even her C6 buffing dmg bonus does not require such a team restriction.
    As such, Chevreuse can be played in many more teams, outside pyro-electro only teams, compared to what Nilou's kit requires.
  </p>

  <h1>Teams</h1>
  <p>She can be played in:
    1) Lyney teams with Kuki, Yae,
    2) Raiden national teams with XL, Bennett.
    3) Yoimiya-Raiden-Bennett teams.
  </p><p>
    Some theorycrafters say none of these teams would be optimal for dps
    as adding Yelan/XQ/Furina for overvape/vapeload and dendro would be a dps increase.
    There is perhaps one situation where the enemy has a constant hydro status, like the hydro tulpa/slime,
    where Chevreuse teams can be better (as hydro subdps will not deal damage to a hydro tulpa).
