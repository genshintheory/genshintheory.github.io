  <p>Qingque (青雀) is a quantum erudition character.
    She can be used on mono-quantum teams alongside Seele and Silver Wolf.
  </p>
  <p>Much of Qingque's damage is based on rng.
    She is a gambler type of character, similar to the Cait Sith in FF7 or Setzer in FF6, relying on chance and luck.
    The game Qingque plays is mahjong / majiang (麻将), a Chinese tile game.
    This game is also called maque (麻雀), using the same 雀 in Qingque's name.
    Que (雀) means sparrow.
    It is not known if Qingque's name is supposed to be a parody of another word zhuque (朱雀), meaning vermillion.
