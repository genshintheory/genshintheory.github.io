<title>Alhaitham</title>

  <p>Alhaitham (艾尔海森) is the first dendro dps introduced in the game and is an upgrade from keqing.
  </p>

  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>His kit looks like a carbon copy of Keqing's, 
    perhaps to symbolize the connection between Aisin Gioro and the Qing dynasty 
    (Aisin-Gioro founded the Qing and were the Qing emperors).
  </p><p>
    His E can teleport him to places and give him dendro infusion.
    His Q is multi-hit.
  </p><p>
    However, there are important differences.
    Whenever he has mirrors, he will have dendro infusion.
    Moreover, attacking while he has mirrors will do an extra projection attack.
    He can have up to 3 mirrors.
    The more mirrors he has, the more damage his projection attack does.
  </p><p>
    His projection attacks have very good aoe and high scalings, and this is one of the upgrades from Keqing.
    Each mirror will make the projection attack do an extra instance of aoe dendro damage.
    So 3 mirrors will do 3 instances, 2 mirrors will do 2, and 1 mirror will do 1.
    The projection attack can proc every 1.6s.
    They have a unique ICD, following a 2-hit rule.
    That is they can apply dendro / proc dendro reactions once every 2 hits.
  </p><p>
    Every 4s, Alhaitham will lose one mirror.
    His E can give him 1-2 mirrors (2 if he has none before casting his E).
    He can also gain 1 mirror by doing a charged/plunging attack (once every 12s).
  </p><p>
    One of his passives convert EM to dmg bonus on E projection atk and Q.
    1000 em will give a max of 100% dmg bonus.
    His E projection attacks and Q have dual scaling (scale with both atk and em).
    Thus, Alhaitham has quadratic EM scaling.
  </p><p>
    His NA sequence involves him kicking his sword and using dual blades.
    His signature weapon also has 88% crit dmg.
    So he has joined the weapon kicking, 70 energy cost, 88% cd gang along with Itto and Yelan.
  </p>


  <h2>Constellations</h2>
  <p>C1 decreases E cd. 
    C2 gives up to 200 em (50 per mirror).
    C6 gives bonus cr and cd and allows his Q to generate 3 mirrors each time.
  </p>

  <h2>Build</h2>
  <p>
    Gilded is bis for damage.
    Do EM/ATK sands, dendro goblet, crit circlet.
  </p><p>
    Best 5 star weapons include foliar, jade cutter, mist, etc.
    Best 4 star weapons include the dongfang Inazuma umbrella weapon, iron sting, harbinger.
  </p>

  <h2>Teams</h2>
  <p>He synergizes well with Nahida, Yaoyao, Raiden, Yae, Kuki, Yelan/XQ, Kujou, etc.
    He can be played in spread and quickbloom teams.
  </p>


  <h2>Calculations</h2>
  <p></p>


  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>In Chinese, Islam is also called 清真 or Qingzhen,
    perhaps befitting of one of the greatest Islamic scholars of all time Al-haitham.
    The scientist Alhaitham specialized in physics and optics,
    which fits how his kit centers on mirrors and light.
    He lived during the Islamic golden age,
    before the Mongol empire and the European Renaissance.
    Long ago, when Europe was backwards and dealing with the plague and nomadic invaders,
    the Middle East was actually the center of western civilization.
    The contributions of Islamic scholars actually laid the foundation for later European breakthroughs in science and technology.
    Europeans borrowed many loanwords from Arabic, including algebra, the branch of mathematics.
    And for thousands of years, parts of Europe including Spain were ruled by the Muslims.
  </p><p>
    Some Eurocentrists then like to point out that the Muslims borrowed a lot of their culture from Greece and Rome
    (Alexander's empire and the Roman empire).
    The genius Islamic scientists based their works on even older Greek scientists such as Euclid and Ptolemy,
    while the Islamic religion is Abrahamic like Christianity from the Roman empire and Judaism.
  </p><p>
    While it's true that the Middle East borrowed some stuff from the Greeks and Romans,
    if you go further back in history, where did the Greeks and Romans borrow their culture from?
    The Greek and Roman alphabets are based on Middle Eastern scripts such as Phoenician and some Egyptian scripts.
    Many Greek gods were borrowed from Sumer based in modern Iraq.
    It is not a stretch to say that the Greek and Roman empires were Middle Eastern empires as well given their geographic stretch,
    with Alexander's empire covering much of Egypt and Persia
    and the Romans reaching Syria and the borders of Iraq.
    The Middle Eastern cultures of Egypt and Sumer predate even the Roman and Greek civilizations.
    Throughout the history of these regions, there has always been an exchange of culture and ideas between Europe and the Middle East,
    oftentimes in the form of war and conquest.
  </p><p>
    The Ai 艾 in Alhaitham is different from the 埃 in Egypt (埃及).
    It is also different from the 爱 in Aisin-Gioro (爱新觉罗).
    By contrast, Klee's mother Alice actually uses the imperial character 爱 (in 爱丽丝).
  </p><p>
    Also, the Al in Alhaitham is a bit different from the Al in Alexander.
    In Arabic, Al (ال) means 'the', whereas Alex is based on a Greek word meaning 'defend'.
    The fact both begin with Al could be a coincidence.
    Al is just a really common sound in the European and Mideast languages, appearing in words like algorithm, algebra, etc.
    It is also funny that the game compares the strength of Cyno and Alhaitham.
  </p><p>
    The Ai in Alhaitham's name also connects to numerous other genius scientists and inventors in history,
    including Edison, Einstein, Isaac Newton who share that same sound in their name.
    During the Sumeru quest story, Alhaitham also discusses some machine learning and AI algorithms.
    And coincidentally, Alhaitham shares the same birthday with Thomas Edison, inventor of the lightbulb.
  </p><p>
    The name of Alhaitham's Q contains another allusion
    to the name of a Chinese person (and his wife) who helped set up a certain science foundation
    at a certain elite university in the USA.
  </p>

  <p>Alhaitham's roommate Kaveh got in trouble for smearing Alhaitham too much for no good reason.</p>

  <p>On Alhaitham's connection with Chinese culture: 
    it is somewhat significant that Alhaitham released in 3.4 during Lantern Rite, which corresponds to a Chinese holiday.
    In the past, Lantern Rite has only ran with Liyue characters only,
    so Alhaitham is almost like a guest of honor.
  </p><p>
    But as mentioned earlier, Alhaitham's design itself is an allusion to the Aisin-Gioro clan who founded China's Qing dynasty.
    And some of his voice actors and other parts of his name allude to different people that were oppressed by the Ming dynasty,
    the predecessor of the Qing.
    The names of several of Alhaitham's talents and constellations allude to different kingdoms/people 
    that the Qing dynasty defeated in its quest to unify China:
    including conquering Taiwan, a kingdom in Sichuan, a dynasty in Beijing, the Southern Ming, suppressing a rebellion in Taiwan 
    (during the Qianlong era).
    The name of Alhaitham's signature weapon also alludes to 1) the clan of the empresses married to various Aisin-Gioro emperors 
    (perhaps related to how Yelan reran in 3.4 after Alhaitham)
    and 2) another clan that was oppressed by the Ming elites.
  </p><p>
    And the Lantern Rite in Chinese is also called Haidengjie (海灯节) or Festival of Sea of Lights.
    At the end of the Qing dynasty, many of the Man people and Aisin-Gioro clan adopted Han Chinese surnames.
    Aisin-Gioro means 'gold' in the Man language, so many adopted the surname Jin (金), meaning gold in Chinese.
    Incidentally, Jin is related to Xiao, who reran alongside Alhaitham.
    Other Aisin clans people changed their surname to 'Hai' (海), related to the Haidengjie,
    as well as the name of a person oppressed during the Ming dynasty.
    Even a play was written about this person and presented to Mao Zedong.
  </p><p>
    Lastly, the Dongfang EM umbrella sword from the 3.3 Inazuma event 
    alludes to another person that was executed during the Ming.
    This sword happens to be one of Alhaitham's best 4 star options.
  </p><p>
    The Ming dynasty executed and oppressed too many people.
