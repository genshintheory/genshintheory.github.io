<title>Alhaitham</title>

  <p>Alhaitham is the first dendro dps introduced in the game and is an upgrade from keqing.
  </p>

  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>His kit looks like a carbon copy of Keqing's, 
    perhaps to symbolize the connection between Aisin Gioro and the Qing dynasty 
    (Aisin-Gioro founded the Qing and were the Qing emperors).
  </p><p>
    His E can teleport him to places and give him dendro infusion.
    His Q is multi-hit.
  </p><p>
    However, there are important differences.
    Whenever he has mirrors, he will have dendro infusion.
    Moreover, attacking while he has mirrors will do an extra projection attack.
    He can have up to 3 mirrors.
    The more mirrors he has, the more damage his projection attack does.
  </p><p>
    His projection attacks have very good aoe and high scalings, and this is one of the upgrades from Keqing.
    Each mirror will make the projection attack do an extra instance of aoe dendro damage.
    So 3 mirrors will do 3 instances, 2 mirrors will do 2, and 1 mirror will do 1.
    The projection attack can proc every 1.6s.
    They have a unique ICD, following a 2-hit rule.
    That is they can apply dendro / proc dendro reactions once every 2 hits.
  </p><p>
    Every 4s, Alhaitham will lose one mirror.
    His E can give him 1-2 mirrors (2 if he has none before casting his E).
    He can also gain 1 mirror by doing a charged/plunging attack.
  </p>

  <p>In Chinese, Islam is also called 清真 or Qingzhen,
    perhaps befitting of one of the greatest Islamic scholars of all time Al-haitham.
    The scientist Alhaitham specialized in physics and optics,
    which fits how his kit centers on mirrors and light.
    He lived during the Islamic golden age,
    before the Mongol empire and the European Renaissance.
    Long ago, when Europe was backwards and dealing with the plague and nomadic invaders,
    the Middle East was actually the center of western civilization.
    The contributions of Islamic scholars actually laid the foundation for later European breakthroughs in science and technology.
    Europeans borrowed many loanwords from Arabic, including algebra, the branch of mathematics.
    And for thousands of years, parts of Europe including Spain were ruled by the Muslims.

  <h2>Constellations</h2>
  <p>C1 decreases E cd.
