  <h2>Orobashi quest</h2>
  <p><i>Quest to make it stop raining on one of the islands</i></p>

  <p>Orobashi was a serpent god that was slain by Raiden around the archon war.
    Orobashi was then buried and sealed on Yashiori island.
    Recently, the Sangonomiya rebels destroyed the wards sealing Orobashi.
    This caused the Tatarigami to spread across the island, making it rain and thunder in perpetuity.
  </p><p>
    When the traveler meets Kaji, he asks if they can help repair the wards on the islands to combat the Tatarigami.
    The sacred stone mounds and thunderbearer mirrors can be used to destroy the barriers created by the Tatarigami.
  </p>
