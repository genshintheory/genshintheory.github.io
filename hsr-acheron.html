  <p>Acheron (黄泉 Huangquan in Chinese) is a Galaxy Ranger.</p>

  <p>So perhaps this is the Beidou-Raiden synergy we have long been waiting for.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are flattered that you wanted to release Acheron as early as 2.1
    and did not delay her all the way until 4.6 and release your favorite characters in 2.3 instead.
  </p>

  <p>Let's look at the beta numbers...
    well, looks like what happened to Huangquan is 10 million worse than the death penalty.
    It is akin to what Zhu Yongle did to Huang Zicheng's family.
  </p><p>
    We don't see how this can be fixed without a complete overhaul of everything: the stats, the numbers, the translation, the kit.
    So let's just say this is a lost cause. 
  </p><p>
    Any expectation of change is hopium, and even if it is anything like Jingliu, even Jingliu was given 2nd highest hp after FX.
    The changes that are needed for Huangquan to be saved have to be similar to what happened to FX in beta, where she was propelled to highest hp.
    But we are cynical. We know the biases and prejudices of certain people very well.
  </p><p>
    It is quite ironic: certain people keep showing hu or huo, but 'Huang' also has 'hu' in it, 
    yet look at what happened to Huangquan, so it's not clear if they like hu or dislike hu.
  </p><p>
    Also for this beta we did an experiment and did nothing for the past month, yet this still happened.
    Reading the translations of the ability names of Huangquan, it seems this was more of a reaction to some other high-level events that happened in the world, outside our control.
    All this tells us whether we do not speak out or whether we do speak out about what we observe, something like Huangquan still happened.
    Thus, we have little incentive to not speak out on this matter.
  </p><p>
    As compensation for what happened to Huangquan...
