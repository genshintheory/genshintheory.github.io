  <p>Acheron (黄泉 Huangquan in Chinese) is a Galaxy Ranger.</p>

  <p>So perhaps this is the Beidou-Raiden synergy we have long been waiting for.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are flattered that you wanted to release Acheron as early as 2.1
    and did not delay her all the way until 4.6 and release your favorite characters in 2.3 instead.
  </p>

  <p>Let's look at the beta numbers...
    well, looks like what happened to Huangquan is worse than the death penalty.
    We don't see how this can be fixed without a complete overhaul of everything: the stats, the numbers, the translation, the kit.
    So let's just say this is a lost cause. 
  </p><p>
    Any expectation of change is hopium, and even if it is anything like Jingliu, even Jingliu was given 2nd highest hp after FX.
    The changes that are needed for Huangquan to be saved have to be similar to what happened to FX in beta, where she was propelled to highest hp.
    But we are cynical. We know the biases and prejudices of certain people very well.
  </p><p>
    As compensation for what happened to Huangquan...
