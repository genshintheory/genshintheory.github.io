  <p>Acheron (黄泉 Huangquan in Chinese) is a Galaxy Ranger.</p>

  <p>So perhaps this is the Beidou-Raiden synergy we have long been waiting for.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are flattered that you wanted to release Acheron as early as 2.1
    and did not delay her all the way until 4.6 and release your favorite characters in 2.3 instead.
  </p>

  <p>Let's look at the beta numbers...
    well, looks like what happened to Huangquan is worse than the death penalty.
  </p><p>
    As compensation for what happened to Huangquan...
