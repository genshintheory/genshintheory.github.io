<title>Acheron</title>

  <p>Acheron (黄泉 Huangquan in Chinese) is a Galaxy Ranger.</p>

  <p>So perhaps this is the Beidou-Raiden synergy we have long been waiting for.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are flattered that you wanted to release Acheron as early as 2.1
    and did not delay her all the way until 4.6 and release your favorite characters in 2.3 instead.
  </p>

  <h2>The beta: Memories of Huang Zicheng</h2>
  <p>Let's look at the beta numbers...
    well, looks like what happened to Huangquan is 10 million times worse than the death penalty.
    It is akin to what Zhu Yongle did to Huang Zicheng's family.
  </p><p>
    Also Mr. Jiang, you killed your own sister Juhuahua.
    They killed Huangquan. 
    They killed her.
    But Juhuahua also has 'hu' in the name, so how come the stats are not buff like Huohuo's?
    You pulled a Huang Zicheng and Hu Changqing in one go.
  </p><p>
    We don't see how this can be fixed without a complete overhaul of everything: the stats, the numbers, the translation, the kit.
    So let's just say this is a lost cause. 
  </p><p>
    Any expectation of change is hopium, and even if it is anything like Jingliu, even Jingliu was given 2nd highest hp after FX.
    The changes that are needed for Huangquan to be saved have to be similar to what happened to FX in beta, where she was propelled to highest hp.
    But we are cynical. We know the biases and prejudices of certain people very well.
  </p><p>
    It is quite ironic: certain people keep showing hu or huo, but 'Huang' also has 'hu' in it, 
    yet look at what happened to Huangquan, so it's not clear if they like hu or dislike hu.
  </p><p>
    Also for this beta we did an experiment and did nothing for the past month, yet this still happened.
    Reading the translations of the ability names of Huangquan, it seems this was more of a reaction to some other high-level events that happened in the world, outside our control.
    All this tells us is that whether we do not speak out or whether we do speak out about what we observe, something like Huangquan still happened.
    Thus, we have little incentive to not speak out on this matter.
  </p><p>
    As compensation for what happened to Huangquan...
  </p>

  <h2>Social mobility</h2>
  <p>Social mobility is a subject often studied.
    The data can be presented in a 2d mobility table,
    where the rows represent the previous generation's status (occupation, rank, income, etc.)
    and the columns represent the next generation's status.
    The diagonal cells mean that the next generation has the same status as the previous.
    That is, it refers to social immobility, no progress.
    Sometimes there may even be downward mobility.
  </p><p>
    Social mobility has been studied across different societies, countries, time frames from Victorian era to present and even further back.
    But we can also study social mobility in the context of video game characters such as those in Honkai Star Rail.
    <!-- social mobility of genshin char -->
    Suppose the socioeconomic status (SES) of an HSR character is approximated by their base atk
    (can also study base def, hp but let's focus on atk for now).
    Then we have an interesting case study:
    in 1.0 Jing Yuan was released,
    and then a year later Huangquan was released.
    This is an example of social immobility, and in fact may even be seen as downward mobility when looking at Ratio.
  </p><p>
    In other words, the kind of corporate culture that HSR promotes is one
    where only characters like Fu Xuan or Ratio experience rapid upward mobility,
    whereas characters like Jing Yuan, Huangquan, Black Swan, Topaz experience no mobility or downward mobility.
    Such a virtual society / system seems clearly designed to oppress certain characters.
