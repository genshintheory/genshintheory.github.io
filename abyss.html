  <p>Some notes on the Spiral Abyss, mostly Floor 12</p>


  <h2>Version 3.5</h2>
  <p>The Setekh Wenut is the most garbage piece of trash boss in the abyss.
    To defeat it and 9 star floor 12, you are almost forced to use Rational,
    several 5 star units, or units with constellations.
    And the units need to be built with good artifacts and stats,
    as the boss is quite unforgiving otherwise.
  </p><p>
    In the overworld it has 60% res to anemo and 25% res to everything else.
    But in the abyss, this is increased to 90% anemo res and 55% res to everything else.
    Moreover, the Wenut spends most of its time underground (similar to the Ruin Serpent),
    giving only short time intervals (mostly <10s) where you can attack it.
    In the abyss, it will fool around underground for around 30-40s.
  </p><p>
    There is one part where the Wenut will fly into the air and summon wind orbs.
    Here you need to apply pyro/electro/hydro/cryo to destroy the wind orbs.
    Once you destroy two orbs the Wenut will fall, become stunned, and have its res to the corresponding element decreased by 45%.
    It is possible to swirl three elements (e.g. pyro/electro/hydro) on the orbs to shred three elements.
    This ~20s period is perhaps the most important window to deal lethal damage to the Wenut.
  </p><p>
    In the total, in the abyss, the time spent underground plus the time it flies up and falls down 
    may take around one minute (one full rotation of the Wenut's moves).
    To three-star the chamber, you only have three minutes.
    And the first half may take one minute, giving you only 2 or 3 rotations of the Wenut's moves.
    In otherwise, you may only get 2 or 3 chances to attack the Wenut in its weakened state
    (which is pretty much the only time you can deal a lot of damage given its high res the rest of the time).
  </p><p>
    In the overworld, the Wenut has less hp compared to abyss, and its res is less,
    so it is very easy to defeat, and you can pretty much use anything you want.
    But in abyss, that is where shredding the res becomes more important.
    The Wenut will have millions of hp and super high res most of the time,
    so even c6 units may not be able to deal a lot of damage during these high-res periods.
    Your dps is almost constrained to the short window where the Wenut is weakened,
    and you almost need to shred res here to do damage (e.g. VV/geo res/destroying the wind orbs).
  </p>
  <p>If you have c6 units, you can go ham and use whatever you want:
    e.g. a c6 Itto geo team with Yae can kill the Wenut quite easily.
    But if you don't have c6 units, you can still kill the Wenut,
    but you may want to strategize a bit more.
  </p>

  <h3>What to bring</h3>
  <p>
    Because destroying the wind orbs shreds 45% res,
    you probably want to bring an electro/pyro/hydro/cryo dps to kill the Wenut.
    If you want you can bring additional sources of res shred such as VV, 
    but that is not necessary for some teams (such as Rational).    
  </p><p>
    To destroy the wind orbs, you will need characters that can hit things in the air.
    You can use bows, but there are many other characters that can do the job.
    For example, Raiden E, Yae, Nahida, and other characters that can jump into the air to hit things
    or that have large vertical aoe (such as Cyno, Itto, Alhaitham, etc).
  </p><p>
    So how does Rational work against Wenut?
    First we refer to the version of Rational with Raiden-Xiangling-XQ/Yelan-Bennett.
    Some versions have Bennett run 4p instructor (for +120em party buff).
    Here Raiden needs to be built well with 4p Emblem and catch or 5 star weapon.
    Unless you have C2 Raiden, you probably need to build the other characters too.
    Xiangling needs to be built well too with 4p Emblem and catch or 5 star weapon.
    If Xiangling is not built well, she will not do damage, and the Wenut will become harder to kill in time.
    XQ/Yelan also need to be built well to do damage (4p Emblem, ER weapon).
    Most importantly, all the characters should have high ER (more than 150% ER each at least)
    do make the clear comfortable.
  </p><p>
    Ideally, start the chamber with everybody's burst up.
    Use XQ/Yelan's burst, Bennett's burst, XL's burst to start and deal damage intermittently
    while the Wenut goes in and out underground.
    Spend this time recharging the three characters' burst too.
    If Raiden has a surplus of ER (like 300%) you can use her burst too and try to recharge it.
    But by the time the Wenut first flies up with the wind orbs,
    everybody's burst needs to be back up.
  </p><p>
    Once the Wenut flies up with the wind orbs,
    use XQ/Yelan's burst and use Raiden's E.
  </p>

  <p>There are probably 4 star teams that can kill the Wenut in the time frame,
    but the Wenut is a boss that becomes easier to kill with 5 star characters (especially Raiden),
    much more so than most other bosses in the abyss. 
  </p>

  <p>The Wenut is universally hated by the community
    and would probably win the title as the most disgusting boss in the abyss to date.
  </p>


  <h2>Version 3.4</h2>
  <p>The blessings buff dendro and quicken.
    One side has ruin machines infused with electro (12-1), consecrated beasts, and the algorithm matrix.
    The other side feature aoe mobs (including triple maguu kenki).
    Use Alhaitham/Rational first half, Xiao second half.
  </p>

  <h2>Version 3.3</h2>
  <p>Geo rifthounds return. 
    The other side features the prism cubes (want quicken) and jadeplume.
    Use Itto and rational.
  </p>

  <h2>Version 3.2</h2>
  <p>They finally killed zhong li with the rifthounds and anti-shield shadowy husks.
    But yet again zhong li was never meta to begin with and was never used much in abyss
    compared to top tier supports like Bennett.
    This is an excellent example of kicking someone when they are down,
    which is exactly what zhong li deserved, like Kautalya in the 3.2 story quest,
    given that public opinion is completely against zhong li.
  </p><p>
    When you're dealing with slimebuckets like the USA imperialists and their capitalist cronies,
    you got to learn some of their bad political habits:
    do the opposite of whatever they are doing,
    whenever your opponent tries to be nice to you mercilessly attack them,
    oppress your enemy so that they never get the chance to celebrate.
    When you are fighting a long term battle,
    you got to think like a long term fighter too.
    And part of that is striking their weakspot and slapping their face at the right moment.
    Whatever you call it: alternative warfare, guerilla warfare, etc.
    it takes a different kind of mindset than just bashing your way head-on into the battlefield.
  </p><p>
    Another favorite tactic of the USA: control the media, manipulate public opinion, and brainwash the masses.
    There is a vision and directive that comes all the way up the greasy political ladder
    from some high-level leadership in the USA deep state.
    They want to force the public to obey and submit to that vision and be completely aligned with it.
    Any dissenter will be attacked, doxed, and harrassed,
    and the deep state will abuse all its levers of power to oppress the divergent.
    The vision of the deep state is to drown out all other opposing voices,
    which contradicts the fundamental tenets of the so-called democracy that the USA is supposedly based on.
    All this democracy bullshit is a political slogan used by the elites to justify their oppression of the plebians.
    They do not care about the lives of the common folk.
    All they do is put on a show to serve their own political interests and themselves.
    They claim to be helping the people, to be egalitarian, to have a 'flat' structure,
    but in reality the only people that benefit are those up above:
    the elites, the capitalists, the imperialists and their crony puppets.
  </p>
  <p>
    That said, the first half of floor 12 suits dendro national quite well 
    (Nahida + Raiden + Yelan + Bennett).
    And Yoimiya is excellent for defeating the thunder creature in the second half.
    Nahida is also excellent for the thunder boss to proc spread,
    making a Yoimiya-Nahida team (Yoimiya-Nahida-Yelan) quite formidable against it.
  </p>


  <h2>Version 3.1</h2>
  <p>Straightforward like last time.
    Bringing an electro character helps for the prism boss.
    Bringing Collei and DMC to proc quicken is fine but not needed to 9 star floor 12.
    Bringing tighnari will actually hurt your overall dps as nari is worse than Collei and DMC.
    This is reflected in nari's low abyss usage stats.
  </p>

  <h2>Version 3.0</h2>
  <p>Abyss is pretty straightforward. It introduces the new ruin dino/drake and the fungi bird.
    Characters like ganyu and tighnari got nerfed as their attacks can easily miss the fungi and ruin drake.
    On the other hand, Itto is an excellent option for dealing with these enemies.
    Yoimiya is also good, and Venti can pull in the fungi enemies.
    As always Xiao is top tier meta whereas things like ayaka or ganyu are below meta.
  </p>

  <h2>Version 2.8</h2>
  <p>Huge buffs for pyro and anemo.
    Great for Diluc, Yoimiya, Xiao, etc.
  </p>

  <h2>Version 2.7 (June 2022)</h2>
  <p>Floor 11 buffs claymore users and also features rock shield hilichurls.
    This is a big win for Xiao, Itto, Diluc, Eula, etc. mains.
    Floor 11 also has the rifthounds, so rip zhongli.
  </p><p>
    Floor 12 first half is a cakewalk.
    Second half features single target enemies.
    So big win for Yoimiya mains.
    Second half chamber 1 applies cryo debuff on enemies,
    and chamber 2 has the maguu, so rip ganyu.
  </p>

  <h2>Version 2.6 (April 2022)</h2>
  <p>In this version's abyss, Vermillion (辰砂往生录), Xiao's set, became the first NEW artifact set to be offered as a completion reward.</p>
  <p>Anemo meta. Floor 11 gives huge Anemo damage boost. Can hit 100k or more on Xiao plunge attacks.
    Floor 12 first half needs hydro for the pyro lectors on 12-3. Mona, Childe, even Barbara are great options.
    First half also favors crowd control units like Venti, Sucrose as most of the enemies can be pulled and lifted.
    Second half has heavier enemies and favors AoE characters. All of the chambers have two or more enemies.
    Floor 12-3 second half needs cryo for hydro lectors. So Chongyun is good option.
    Floor 12-2 second half features an interesting trio of Electro lector, Pyro lector, and Hydro herald.
    Anemo is good for swirling the elements and breaking the shields simultaneously.
    Cryo breaks hydro shield, hydro breaks pyro shield, and pyro breaks electro shield.
    One can also use anemo to swirl the pyro and electro to break the electro shield (swirl prioritizes pyro over electro).
    So Floor 12 second half is good for freeze teams like Shenhe, Chongyun, Mona, etc.
    Mona is good on either half.
    Even a Xiao-Chongyun-Mona-Jean team works for full clearing the floor.
  </p><p>
    This is the type of abyss where Zhongli is not needed at all.
    But yet again, no abyss ever needs Zhongli in the first place.
    Anemo units carry all the way.
  </p><p>
    Ayaka and Ayato will struggle as they have huge energy issues and expensive 80 cost bursts.
  </p>

  <h2>Version 2.5 (March 2022)</h2>
  <p>
    Version 2.5 is a pretty simple abyss on the first half.
    The second half features the new bathysmal vishaps (from Enkanomiya) and the Golden rifthound boss.
    First half has electro rifthounds, while second half has the geo rifthound.
    Similar to Version 2.3 abyss, this abyss benefits electro teams 1st half and geo teams 2nd half.
    For example: Yae (the new character) and Raiden teams for 1st half, Itto and Xiao double geo teams for 2nd half.    
  </p><p>
    Non-meta inferior midget characters like Ganyu and Ayaka will struggle Floor 12-1-2 as it is difficult for them to group up the vishaps.
  </p>

  <h2>Version 2.4 (January-February 2022)</h2>
  <p>
    Floor 12<br>
    Half 1: Perpetual Mechanical Array (pma), Primo Geovishap (pyro infusion), Ruin machines<br>
    Half 2: Pyro lector (some geo rifthound whelps), 2 Hydro heralds, 1 Maguu Kenki
  </p>
  <p>Neither side particularly favors Pyro since the geovishap will have increased pyro res and the pyro lector has a pyro shield.
    So Hu Tao will struggle.
    That said, some people still 9 star it with pyro dps like Yoimiya.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's first discuss half 2 since this half basically forces you to bring certain characters.
    Use hydro for the pyro lector. If struggling with time, use two hydro characters (if available).
    Also bring a healer to deal with the rifthounds and the damge over time (dot) dealt by the lector.
    Use cryo for the hydro herald (e.g. Chongyun). Similarly, using two cryo characters may help clear the chamber more easily.
    You would think the 2nd half is for freeze teams, but then the big fat Lv. 100 maguu kenki in chamber 3 cannot be frozen,
    and it can block ranged attacks.
    Just bring enough dps.
    It appears that Genshin's intention was to make half 2 favorable for the featured characters Shenhe and Chongyun.
  </p><p>
    In the 1st half, some enemies will have the 'Honed Spirit' effect. 
    If you attack them with normal attacks, they can lose up to 30% all RES (which resets periodically). 
    All of these enemies (pma, vishap, ruin machines) have increased Physical RES, but if you want to use Eula, feel free.
    Eula could be more useful in the 2nd half against the maguu kenki (but will need other supports to deal with the lector and herald).
  </p>
  <p>Xiao works fantastically for either side. People have 9 starred abyss using Xiao on either the 1st or 2nd half.
    For Itto, the 2nd half seems more favorable with the geo rifthounds 
    and also the fact that the geovishap on the 1st half has increased Geo RES.
    That said, people have cleared the 1st half with a C6 Itto.
  </p>
  <p>
    If using Venti put him on the 2nd half in a freeze team since the 1st half features entirely heavy enemies.
    Otherwise, use Sucrose or anemo on the freeze team for buffing.
  </p>
  <p>For the 1st half just bring any dps team: Xiao teams, Itto teams, Raiden national are teams that work from experience.
    For the 2nd half, you basically need a cryo and a hydro, preferably 2 cryo characters for the hydro herald.
    The cryo characters can be Chongyun, Shenhe, Diona, Rosaria, etc.
    The 4th slot can be anything: Xiao, Yoimiya, Sucrose all work.
  </p><p>
    Whales with C6 characters can do anything.
    People have used C6 Xiao with just Kazuha, Bennett, and Raiden to clear the 2nd half (no hydro, no cryo characters) with 9 stars.
    C6 Xiao simply did so much damage that having the appropriate element to deal with the shield did not even matter.
  </p>
  

  <h2>Version 2.3 (December 2021/January 2022)</h2>
  <p>
    Floor 12<br>
    Half 1: Electro rifthounds and geovishaps<br>
    Half 2: Geo rifthounds and triple maguu kenki
  </p><p>
    Half 1 teams: Raiden national, Beidou, etc.<br>
    Half 2 teams: Itto geo, Xiao double geo, etc.
  </p><p>
    Electro and Geo dps have a big boost from the rifthounds losing a lot of res (\(20-30=-10\)% for whelps, \(25-65=-40\)% for big hounds).
    At least for the big rifthounds (the hp sponges/tanks), this amounts to a \(1.2/.75 = 1.6\) multiplicative increase in damage, which is quite broken (it's around or a bit more than a Bennett buff, except basically permanent).
    So this abyss was very gimmicky, greatly awarding electro and geo damage dealers specifically.
  </p><p>
    The maguu kenki cannot be frozen.
    Having aoe to deal with the triple maguu kenki helps.
    Beidou works very well when there are exactly 2 enemies, which does happen in the chambers of half 1.
  </p><p>
    Because of corrosion from the rifthounds, having heavy healers like Qiqi, Jean, Kokomi, or even Barbara is quite useful,
    if not a must since the corrosion bleeds through shields.
  </p><p>
    The theme of Version 2.3 was to buff Geo dps and healers through the new artifact set (husk/clam) and the abyss.
  </p>
