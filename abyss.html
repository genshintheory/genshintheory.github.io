  <p>Some notes on the Spiral Abyss, mostly Floor 12</p>

  <h2>Version 2.3</h2>
  <p>
    Floor 12 featured Electro rifthounds and geovishaps on half 1
    and Geo rifthounds and triple maguu kenki on half 2.
  </p><p>
    Half 1 teams: Raiden national, Beidou, etc.
  </p><p>
    Half 2 teams: Itto geo, Xiao double geo, etc.
  </p><p>
    Electro and Geo dps have a big boost from the rifthounds losing a lot of res (20-30=-10% for whelps, 25-65=-40% for big hounds).
    At least for the big rifthounds (the hp sponges/tanks), this amounts to a 1.2/.75 = 1.6 multiplicative increase in damage, which is quite broken (it's around or a bit more than a Bennett buff, except basically permanent).
    So this abyss was very gimmicky, greatly awarding electro and geo damage dealers specifically.
  </p><p>
    The maguu kenki cannot be frozen.
    Having aoe to deal with the triple maguu kenki helps.
    Beidou works very well when there are exactly 2 enemies, which does happen in the chambers of half 1.
