  <p>Some notes on the Spiral Abyss, mostly Floor 12</p>

  <h2>Version 2.5 (March 2022)</h2>
  <p>
    Version 2.5 is a pretty simple abyss on the first half.
    The second half features the new bathysmal vishaps (from Enkanomiya) and the Golden rifthound boss.
    First half has electro rifthounds, while second half has the geo rifthound.
    Similar to Version 2.3 abyss, this abyss benefits electro teams 1st half and geo teams 2nd half.
    For example: Yae (the new character) and Raiden teams for 1st half, Itto and Xiao double geo teams for 2nd half.    
  </p><p>
    Non-meta inferior midget characters like Ganyu and Ayaka will struggle Floor 12-1-2 as it is difficult for them to group up the vishaps.
  </p>

  <h2>Version 2.4 (January-February 2022)</h2>
  <p>
    Floor 12<br>
    Half 1: Perpetual Mechanical Array (pma), Primo Geovishap (pyro infusion), Ruin machines<br>
    Half 2: Pyro lector (some geo rifthound whelps), 2 Hydro heralds, 1 Maguu Kenki
  </p>
  <p>Neither side particularly favors Pyro since the geovishap will have increased pyro res and the pyro lector has a pyro shield.
    So Hu Tao will struggle.
    That said, some people still 9 star it with pyro dps like Yoimiya.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's first discuss half 2 since this half basically forces you to bring certain characters.
    Use hydro for the pyro lector. If struggling with time, use two hydro characters (if available).
    Also bring a healer to deal with the rifthounds and the damge over time (dot) dealt by the lector.
    Use cryo for the hydro herald (e.g. Chongyun). Similarly, using two cryo characters may help clear the chamber more easily.
    You would think the 2nd half is for freeze teams, but then the big fat Lv. 100 maguu kenki in chamber 3 cannot be frozen,
    and it can block ranged attacks.
    Just bring enough dps.
    It appears that Genshin's intention was to make half 2 favorable for the featured characters Shenhe and Chongyun.
  </p><p>
    In the 1st half, some enemies will have the 'Honed Spirit' effect. 
    If you attack them with normal attacks, they can lose up to 30% all RES (which resets periodically). 
    All of these enemies (pma, vishap, ruin machines) have increased Physical RES, but if you want to use Eula, feel free.
    Eula could be more useful in the 2nd half against the maguu kenki (but will need other supports to deal with the lector and herald).
  </p>
  <p>Xiao works fantastically for either side. People have 9 starred abyss using Xiao on either the 1st or 2nd half.
    For Itto, the 2nd half seems more favorable with the geo rifthounds 
    and also the fact that the geovishap on the 1st half has increased Geo RES.
    That said, people have cleared the 1st half with a C6 Itto.
  </p>
  <p>
    If using Venti put him on the 2nd half in a freeze team since the 1st half features entirely heavy enemies.
    Otherwise, use Sucrose or Kazuha on the freeze team for buffing.
  </p>
  <p>For the 1st half just bring any dps team: Xiao teams, Itto teams, Raiden national are teams that work from experience.
    For the 2nd half, you basically need a cryo and a hydro, preferably 2 cryo characters for the hydro herald.
    The cryo characters can be Chongyun, Shenhe, Diona, Rosaria, etc.
    The 4th slot can be anything: Xiao, Yoimiya, Kazuha all work.
  </p><p>
    Whales with C6 characters can do anything.
    People have used C6 Xiao with just Kazuha, Bennett, and Raiden to clear the 2nd half (no hydro, no cryo characters) with 9 stars.
    C6 Xiao simply did so much damage that having the appropriate element to deal with the shield did not even matter.
  </p>
  

  <h2>Version 2.3 (December 2021/January 2022)</h2>
  <p>
    Floor 12<br>
    Half 1: Electro rifthounds and geovishaps<br>
    Half 2: Geo rifthounds and triple maguu kenki
  </p><p>
    Half 1 teams: Raiden national, Beidou, etc.<br>
    Half 2 teams: Itto geo, Xiao double geo, etc.
  </p><p>
    Electro and Geo dps have a big boost from the rifthounds losing a lot of res (\(20-30=-10\)% for whelps, \(25-65=-40\)% for big hounds).
    At least for the big rifthounds (the hp sponges/tanks), this amounts to a \(1.2/.75 = 1.6\) multiplicative increase in damage, which is quite broken (it's around or a bit more than a Bennett buff, except basically permanent).
    So this abyss was very gimmicky, greatly awarding electro and geo damage dealers specifically.
  </p><p>
    The maguu kenki cannot be frozen.
    Having aoe to deal with the triple maguu kenki helps.
    Beidou works very well when there are exactly 2 enemies, which does happen in the chambers of half 1.
  </p><p>
    Because of corrosion from the rifthounds, having heavy healers like Qiqi, Jean, Kokomi, or even Barbara is quite useful,
    if not a must since the corrosion bleeds through shields.
  </p><p>
    The theme of Version 2.3 was to buff Geo dps and healers through the new artifact set (husk/clam) and the abyss.
