  <p>The quest with Xiyan talks about the Hero's Journey, the protagonist model, and literature.</p>
  <p>The game cheated a bit in the quest by giving Lunae 3 free stacks of squama each turn
    regardless of how other teammates spent sp
    (which in practice is usually not possible).
    As a result, this gave a distorted view of how Lunae's kit works (an example of false advertising).
    In reality, one usually needs to be considerate of SP economy as Lunae may not be able to spend 3 sp per turn.
