<title>Traveler</title>

  </head>
  
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  <p>The traveler is unique among current playable characters in that they can change elements.
    This is done by activating different statues of the seven in different nations.
    (While <a href='tartaglia.html'>Childe</a> is shown to wield an electro delusion,
    he is only playable as a hydro character.
    And we are unable to play in delusion form.)
  </p><p>
    There is a theory that the traveler's abilities are similar to those of the archon of the corresponding <a href='elements.html'>element</a>.
    For example, the Anemo traveler has vacuum and cc abilities similar to Venti.
    The Geo traveler can create geo constructs like Morax.
    The Electro traveler can restore energy like Raiden.
    Certain aspects of the traveler's kit are indeed similar to the archons,
    but there are also differences.
  </p>

  <h2>Story</h2>
  <p>At the start the traveler and their twin sibling fight some unknown god.
    You choose which sibling to play as (male or female).
    The traveler is then encased in cubes from the unknown god and gets separated from their sibling.
    Some time later the traveler wakes up in Teyvat and fishes Paimon out of the coast of Mondstadt (facing towards the time island).
    The traveler and Paimon then travel through Teyvat's nations in search of their sibling.
    Along the way they meet Dainsleif, a mysterious figure from Khaenriah.
    The traveler learns that their sibling had witnessed the destruction of Khaenriah around 500 years ago
    and had since then become the leader of the Abyss.
    The traveler continues their journey, determined that they will one day be reunited.
  </p>

  <h2>Teams</h2>
  <p>The traveler does have specialized use in various teams.
    The c6 anemo traveler can be used in Xiao teams to shred -20% anemo res through the q.
    The geo traveler can be used in Itto mono geo teams (geo traveler q can buff crit rate and provide sub-dps).
    The electro traveler can be used in Eula superconduct teams if one does not have the Raiden Shogun.
    The dendro traveler can be used in dendro <a href='national.html'>national</a> teams.
  </p><p>
    The anemo traveler also has cc abilities that can push away enemies from monoliths in certain spiral abyss challenges.
    The geo traveler's meteorite can also block archer arrows from hitting the monolith.
  </p>

  <h2>Build</h2>
  <p>Do ATK-dmg bonus-CRIT.
    For dendro traveler (DMC), one can use gilded or deepwood.
    The DMC has an EM to dmg bonus % conversion, and gilded can give up to 230 EM.
    If one already has another teammate using deepwood (like Collei),
    then using gilded on DMC is much better than deepwood.
  </p>

  <h2>Calculations</h2>
  <h3>Geo traveler</h3>
  <p>Geo traveler can be used in Itto teams for sub-dps and crit rate buff.
    Suppose level 13 E and 61.6$ geo dmg bonus (from say petra).
    Ignore any other buffs (like Gorou's field).
    The cd is 8s but a passive reduces this by 2s to 6s (a 8/6=1.33 times increase in dps). 
    The dps is then
    $$x_E = 527*1.616/6 = 141.9386666667$$
  </p><p>
    With c1, the Q can increase crit rate and interruption resistance (poise).
    The Q can hit 4 times. Each shockwave has 314.5% scaling at level 13.
    The cd is 15s. The dps is
    $$x_Q = 4*324.5*1.616/15 = 139.8378666667$$
    The total dps from spamming skills and bursts on cd is
    $$x = x_E + x_Q = 281.7765$$
  </p>

  <h2>Trivia</h2>
  <p>The female traveler has higher charged attack scaling than the male traveler.</p>
