  <p>Hanya 寒鸦 uses the 鸦 character also found in opium.
    Based on the 寒 and her clothing design, one would think she is cryo, but nope she is physical.
    That is actually ok since Eula is cryo but also a physical dps.

  <h2>Kit</h2>
  <p>Her E applies a debuff to one enemy.
    Every 2 hits the enemy receives will recover 1 sp, up to two times.
    This can be useful for characters that can consume a ton of sp such as QQ or Lunae.
    It is also just useful overall.
