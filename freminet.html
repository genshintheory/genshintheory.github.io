  <h2>Build</h2>
  <p>The test run had him on 4p blizzard with Mika.</p>


  <h2>Breaking the 1st island chain</h2>
  <p>Freminet broke through the 1st island chain or the 1st line of defense of Albedo and Morax.
    For three years, Xinyan was the 4 star with the highest base atk. And Albedo and Morax were slightly above her.
    But now Freminet became the first 4 star character to have higher base atk than Albedo and Morax.
