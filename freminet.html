<title>Freminet</title>

  <p>Freminet is Lyney's sibling and the creator of Pers.</p>
  <p>I. M. Pei is known for designing the Louvre in Paris, 
    seeing how an NPC named Peixiu was also introduced in 3.8 before Fontaine.
  </p>


  <h2>Kit</h2>
  <p>Freminet is a physical dps whose burst allows E spam (like C6 Xiao or Cyno).
    Generally in games like Genshin, abilities that allow infinite spam are considered the creme of broken.
    This is why C6 Xiao and C6 Itto are highly valuable.
    Everything else is usually considered good or great.
    But to break through to god tier realm, one usually needs to incorporate some aspect of infinity.
  </p><p>
    But infinity may not be enough. High scaling is also needed.
    If Freminet could spam nukes with his E like C6 Xiao or C6 Itto's CA, then he would be one of the most broken dps.
  </p><p>
    As the old adage goes, infinity times zero is sometimes zero.
    A simple example is the limit:
    $$\lim_{x\to \infty} f(x)g(x) = 0$$
    where \(f(x) = x, g(x) = 1/x^2\).
    The point is, yes infinite things can be good, but you want to have infinite nukes for godly damage rather than infinite times zero.
  </p><p>
    Speaking of which, some French figures such as Ren√© Descartes, Cauchy, Legendre, Laplace, Fourier
    made several contributions to mathematics and physics.
    The European colonial era also saw the rise of several brilliant minds such as Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, etc.
    This is alongside the technological advances and industrial revolutions of the Fontaine nations.

  <h2>Build</h2>
  <p>The test run had him on 4p blizzard with Mika in a freeze team (no electro for superconduct).</p>


  <h2>Breaking the 1st island chain</h2>
  <p>Freminet broke through the 1st island chain or the 1st line of defense of Albedo and Morax.
    For three years, Xinyan was the 4 star with the highest base atk. And Albedo and Morax were slightly above her.
    But now Freminet became the first 4 star character to have higher base atk than Albedo and Morax.

  <p>His diver helmet resembles the big daddy from the bioshock game.</p>
