<title>SR Version 1.5</title>

<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  
  <p>The Ashblazing Grand Duke (giving dmg bonus and atk)
    is an improvement from the original lightning relic set for Jing Yuan.
    Still, other sets give crit rate and def shred, so what gives?
  </p>


  <h2>Tale of Haunted</h2>
  <p>Swallowsong Pavilion:
    as the enemies can steal sp (like Phantylia),
    characters that are sp neutral/positive help here,
    such as Blade, Jingliu, Topaz, etc.
  </p>


  <h2>Dr. Dig Martial Tournament</h2>
  <p>Day 1: encourages mono physical, Argenti (Ginshi) and Luka are broken here (ofc the buff dealing extra dmg based on percent of enemy hp helps)</p>
  <p>Day 2: encourages mono cryo, want constant ice weakness break to freeze enemies; have ultimate apply freeze helps; and then restore 100% energy after ult
    (for infinite freeze and ult); 
    besides Jingliu, Herta works here too
  </p>
  <p>Day 3: Himeko, Topaz work here for lots of pyro follow up attacks; preservation TB works for aoe pyro too</p>
  <p>Day 4: dot day, Blade is probably best wind option for aoe besides Sampo (currently no erudition anemo)</p>
  <p>Day 5: mono quantum would work, besides Seele and SW (Ginrou), QQ and Lynx can work</p>
  <p>Day 6: mono imaginary can work</p>
  <p>Day 7: Jing Yuan, Arlan are broken here (ultimate spam)</p>

  <p>Above are like enhanced elemental resonances (greatly exaggerated).
    Silver Wolf can work each day in mono teams to add weakness of the corresponding element.
  </p>


  <h2>Corruption Cases</h2>
  <p>We can start documenting cases of discrimination for HSR too.
    HSR overall is much worse than Genshin in this regard.
  </p>
  <p>Flagship Event Foxian Tale of Haunted:
    This was mostly ok except for the last story about Qingque, Fu Xuan.
    It would be better if we could fight characters with different names,
    such as those used by the USA FBI and CIA water army that manipulates media online.
    Also the 1.1 story with Norbert was entertaining.
  </p><p>
    Although this is an improvement from 1.3, this last part may cost 1.5's rating to drop.
    For example, if most of 1.5 was S tier, then screwups like this would cause 1.5 to drop to A or even B tier.
    A final verdict will be announced at a later time.
    We will adopt the same policy as some other people do and keep people waiting, not knowing when the punishment will come.
    It is not often we have a chance to be creative with punishments.
  </p>
  <p>Stellar Shadowseeker: day 4, 6 ordering of names indicates discrimination, bias, favoritism based on name.
    Switching days 4 and 5 would improve the event.
  </p>
  <p>Scheduling of events to align with certain dates in Genshin indicates politically motivated scheduling.
    This will be factored into the ratings of the corresponding versions.
