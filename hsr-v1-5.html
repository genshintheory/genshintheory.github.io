  <p>The Ashblazing Grand Duke (giving dmg bonus and atk)
    is an improvement from the original lightning relic set for Jing Yuan.
    Still, other sets give crit rate and def shred, so what gives?
  </p>


  <h2>Tale of Haunted</h2>
  <p>Swallowsong Pavilion:
    as the enemies can steal sp (like Phantylia),
    characters that are sp neutral/positive help here,
    such as Blade, Jingliu, Topaz, etc.
  </p>


  <h2>Dr. Dig Martial Tournament</h2>
  <p>Day 1: encourages mono physical, Argenti and Luka are broken here (ofc the buff dealing extra dmg based on percent of enemy hp helps)</p>
  <p>Day 2: encourages mono cryo, want constant ice weakness break to freeze enemies; have ultimate apply freeze helps; and then restore 100% energy after ult
    (for infinite freeze and ult); 
    besides Jingliu, Herta works here too
  </p>
  <p>Day 3: Himeko, Topaz work here for lots of pyro follow up attacks</p>

  <p>Above are like enhanced elemental resonances (greatly exaggerated).
    Silver Wolf can work each day in mono teams to add weakness of the corresponding element.
  </p>


  <h2>Corruption Cases</h2>
  <p>We can start documenting cases of discrimination for HSR too.
    HSR overall is much worse than Genshin in this regard.
  </p>
  <p>Stellar Shadowseeker: day 4, 6 ordering of names indicates discrimination, bias, favoritism based on name.
    Switching days 4 and 5 would improve the event.
  </p>
  <p>Scheduling of events to align with certain dates in Genshin indicates politically motivated scheduling.
    This will be factored into the ratings of the corresponding versions.
