<p><b>Sangonomiya Kokomi</b> (珊瑚宮心海) of Watatsumi Island is a healer released in Version 2.1.
  In accordance with the 0 sum mentality of certain USA elites:
  Kokomi is better than Ayaka and does more damage.

<p>The name Sango as well as her C6 Sango Isshin (Shanhu Yixin)
  is an early example of interference in corporate affairs.
  Other characters such as Kaveh and Mika are later examples of interference in corporate affairs,
  using voice actors to combine the names of coworkers in order to influence office politics.
  This suggests Genshin is trying to build a clique of political allies around Sango Isshin.
</p>

<h2>Talents</h2>
<p>Her healing and her burst damage all scale with HP.  
  Her jellyfish (E) heals on field characters within an AoE. It has no ICD on the hydro application.
  </p><p>
  Her burst (Q) refreshes her E's duration and allows her NA to heal the entire party (including off field characters).
  Moreover her NA gain bonus damage based on her HP and healing bonus.
  She can also walk on water during her 10 second burst.
  The energy cost is 70, same as Xiao and Itto.
  </p>

  <p>
  With one of her passives, Kokomi gets -100% CRIT Rate (so initial of \(5-100=-95\)%) but increased Healing Bonus.
</p><p>
  For a burst damage build, talent priority is Q = AA > E.
  For a pure off field healing build, priority is E > Q > AA.
</p>

<h2>Build</h2>
<p>For a burst damage dealer, the Ocean Clam (released in Version 2.3) 4 piece is her bis.  
  If you only care about her off field healing (her E), 
  then 2 piece Tenacity with 2 piece Clam / 2 piece Heart of Depth is also viable.
  Noblesse Oblige can also work.
</p><p>
  HP sands, HP/Hydro DMG goblet, Healing bonus circlet.
  Substats: HP, ER.
  This will maximize her healing and damage (since it scales with HP and healing bonus).
  Note she gains Hydro damage bonus upon ascension.
</p><p>
  For the 4 piece Clam set, most of her damage will be from the bubble pop on the 4 piece set 
  (which does more damage the more you heal, up to 30k before Physical RES is factored),
  so you still want to maximize her healing.
</p><p>
  One of her best weapons is simply the R5 Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer.
</p>

<h2>Teams</h2>
<p>
  Kokomi is typically used in Freeze teams, Electro-charged teams, the meme Kokomon team, bloom teams,
  or basically any team that needs healing
  (like against the rifthounds or other bleed mechanics).
  </p><p>
  Even though her E has no ICD so she can technically be used in vape teams (she can keep up with Xiangling's Pyronado),
  for vape teams usually Childe or Xingqiu are preferred as Hydro applicators.  
  </p><p>
  Note in freeze teams, usually Mona or Xingqiu are run for off field hydro application, whereas Kokomi takes field time away from your Cryo and Anemo units.
  </p><p>
  Electro-charged teams with Beidou and Raiden are viable.
  In such teams, even a Cryo unit (like Rosaria, Kaeya, or possibly Shenhe) 
  can be run as the Superconduct reaction will lower enemy's Physical RES and make Kokomi's bubble do more damage.
  </p><p>
  The Kokomon team consisting of Kokomi, Xiangling, Fischl, Sucrose (and their pokemon) is an example of a team
  that can trigger 4 way elemental reactions.
  Basically the hydro and electro element can coexist on one enemy. Then the pyro element can be applied to another enemy.
  Then using Sucrose as a driver to swirl these elements can create a big explosion
  where the enemies will simultaneously be applied with hydro, electro, pyro, anemo (from swirl).
</p>

<h2>Calculations</h2>
<p>There are two parts to her dps: her Q dps and the Ocean Clam dps.
  Assume 30k hp and lv10 NA, E, Q.
  Assume 4p Clam with \(46.6+28.8=75.4\% \) hydro dmg bonus
  and \(25+15=40\% \) healing bonus.
</p><p>
  At lv10, her NA gets an additive bonus of 12.77% hp.
  With her passive 15% of her healing bonus is converted into extra hp scaling.
  So for 40% healing bonus, she gets an additional 6% hp scaling,
  giving an additive bonus of 18.77% hp for her NA.
  This is equivalent to 187.7% atk scaling per NA.
</p><p>
  Suppose she uses her 3-hit NA combo 5 times within the Q's 10s interval
  (this becomes easier to achieve with atk spd buffs like Mika's).
  The burst has a cd of 18s.
  Her Q does an initial hit of 18.75% hp or around 187.5% atk scaling.
  The mv is
  $$x_b = (187.5+5*(123.08+110.77+169.75+3*187.7))*1.754/18 = 489.3$$
  This is actually higher than Ayaka's mv.
  Moreover, the scaling of an individual NA goes up to \(169.75+187.7=357.45\)
  which is considered a nuke for a hydro attack (given this can vape).
  By contrast, Ayato's NA scalings are around 100%.
</p><p>
  However, Kokomi cannot crit.
  Assuming a 'normal' character can reach 100% crit rate and 200% crit dmg
  (giving a crit multiplier of 3),
  this means her above mv is slashed by 3:
  $$z_b = x_b/3 = 163.1$$
  Above we did not account for possible vapes,
  but that would not fix her fundamental setback of not being able to crit.
  Even if she vapes all her NA (impossible due to ICD),
  the above would double to around 300 mv, which is still low.
  As such, Kokomi's potential as a burst dps is limited,
  while she is better suited as a support.
</p><p>
  If Kokomi's C6 allowed her to crit, then she would at least be decent.
