<p><b>Sangonomiya Kokomi</b> (珊瑚宮心海) of Watatsumi Island is a healer released in Version 2.1.
  In accordance with the 0 sum mentality of certain USA elites:
  Kokomi is better than Ayaka and does more damage.
</p>

<h2>Talents</h2>
<p>Her healing and her burst damage all scale with HP.  
  Her jellyfish (E) heals on field characters within an AoE. It has no ICD on the hydro application.
  </p><p>
  Her burst (Q) refreshes her E's duration and allows her NA to heal the entire party (including off field characters).
  Moreover her NA gain bonus damage based on her HP and healing bonus.
  She can also walk on water during her 10 second burst.
  The energy cost is 70, same as Xiao and Itto.
  </p><p>
  With one of her passives, Kokomi gets -100% CRIT Rate (so initial of \(5-100=-95\)%) but increased Healing Bonus.
</p><p>
  For a burst damage build, talent priority is Q = AA > E.
  For a pure off field healing build, priority is E > Q > AA.
</p>

<h2>Build</h2>
<p>For a burst damage dealer, the Ocean Clam 4 (released in Version 2.3) piece is her bis.  
  If you only care about her off field healing (her E), 
  then 2 piece Tenacity with 2 piece Clam / 2 piece Heart of Depth is also viable.
  Noblesse Oblige can also work.
</p><p>
  HP sands, HP/Hydro DMG goblet, Healing bonus circlet.
  Substats: HP, ER.
  This will maximize her healing and damage (since it scales with HP and healing bonus).
  Note she gains Hydro damage bonus upon ascension.
</p><p>
  For the 4 piece Clam set, most of her damage will be from the bubble pop on the 4 piece set 
  (which does more damage the more you heal, up to 30k before Physical RES is factored),
  so you still want to maximize her healing.
</p><p>
  One of her best weapons is simply the R5 Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer.
</p>

<h2>Teams</h2>
<p>
  Kokomi is typically used in Freeze teams, Electro-charged teams, the meme Kokomon team, or basically any team that needs healing
  (like against the rifthounds or other bleed mechanics).
  </p><p>
  Even though her E has no ICD so she can technically be used in vape teams (she can keep up with Xiangling's Pyronado),
  for vape teams usually Childe or Xingqiu are preferred as Hydro applicators.  
  </p><p>
  Note in freeze teams, usually Mona or Xingqiu are run for off field hydro application, whereas Kokomi takes field time away from your Cryo and Anemo units.
  </p><p>
  Electro-charged teams with Beidou and Raiden are viable.
  In such teams, even a Cryo unit (like Rosaria, Kaeya, or possibly Shenhe) 
  can be run as the Superconduct reaction will lower enemy's Physical RES and make Kokomi's bubble do more damage.
  </p><p>
  The Kokomon team consisting of Kokomi, Xiangling, Fischl, Sucrose (and their pokemon) is an example of a team
  that can trigger 4 way elemental reactions.
  Basically the hydro and electro element can coexist on one enemy. Then the pyro element can be applied to another enemy.
  Then using Sucrose as a driver to swirl these elements can create a big explosion
  where the enemies will simultaneously be applied with hydro, electro, pyro, anemo (from swirl).
