  <p>His burst provides one of the best ATK buffs in the game.</p>

  <h2>Build</h2>
  <p>4 piece noblesse. Can go damage route with ATK-Pyro-CRIT or support build with ER sands and HP goblet or circlet.
    For substats, ER is good. ATK, CRIT, HP are fine too.
  </p><p>
    Bennett works with almost every character and team in the game.
    He does have anti-synergy with Hu Tao as healing her will make her lose buffs.
    And Bennett's C6 which gives a pyro infusion can mess up some characters such as
    physical carries like Eula and Qing as her electro infusion will be overridden.
    But for most other characters whose infusion cannot be overridden by Bennett's C6,
    his C6 is not the end of the world.
    It even gives a modest pyro dmg bonus, which is good for pyro carries like Diluc or Yoimiya.
  </p><p>
    Bennett's key constellations are his C1 (which removes the HP requirement for his ATK buff)
    and his C5 (which adds 3 levels to his Q).
    Many players would just stop at his C5 and not activate his C6 due to its anti-synergy with some characters mentioned above.
