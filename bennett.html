  <p>His burst provides one of the best ATK buffs in the game.</p>

  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <h3>Burst: Fantastic Voyage (美妙旅程)</h3>
  <p>His burst heals and provides a broken ATK buff.
    The ATK buff scales with Bennett's base attack (weapon ATK + character leveling ATK).
    If there is any 4 star burst worth crowning, this is it (unless Genshin releases a Bennett 2.0).
  </p><p>
    The burst will also apply pyro to those inside, so it can remove things like Azhdaha marks and some ley line effects.
    When paired with Jean's burst (which applies Anemo), it can create the so-called 'sunfire' effect,
    which is great for shredding lector shields.
  </p><p>
    With one of Bennett's passives, the cd of his E is reduced inside his Q.
    This makes it easier for Bennett to spam his E more in his Q.
    Both his E and Q apply 2B pyro on cast, so Bennett is simply one of the best characters for shredding Electro shields.
  </p><p>
    Several abilities can snapshot Bennett's ATK buff when cast inside the circle.
    But not everything does (like Xingqiu's Q or Yae's E).
  </p><p>
    For a moderately invested build (2000 ATK on the dps character)
    and a maxed Bennett (c5, lv13 q, aquila sword, lv90), 
    his buff can increase damage by around 1.5 times (<a href='formula.html'>formula</a>).
  </p>


  <h2>Build</h2>
  <p>4 piece noblesse. Can go damage route with ATK-Pyro-CRIT or support build with ER sands and HP goblet or circlet.
    For substats, ER is good. ATK, CRIT, HP are fine too.
  </p><p>
    Bennett wants swords with high base ATK. Having ER on the sword is nice too.
    Aquila Favonia (for high base ATK) and the Skyward sword (with ER) are good 5 star options.
    For 4 stars, high base attack ER swords like Festering Desire are fine.
  </p><p>
    Bennett works with almost every character and team in the game.
    He does have anti-synergy with Hu Tao as healing her will make her lose buffs.
    And Bennett's C6 which gives a pyro infusion can mess up some characters such as
    physical carries like Eula and Qing as her electro infusion will be overridden.
    But for most other characters whose infusion cannot be overridden by Bennett's C6,
    his C6 is not the end of the world.
    It even gives a modest pyro dmg bonus, which is good for pyro carries like Diluc or Yoimiya.
  </p><p>
    Bennett's key constellations are his C1 (which removes the HP requirement for his ATK buff)
    and his C5 (which adds 3 levels to his Q).
    Many players would just stop at his C5 and not activate his C6 due to its anti-synergy with some characters mentioned above.
