  <p>
    Kaeya Alberich has higher NA scalings than Ayaka.
  </p>

  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>E does cryo spray. Q creates cryo ring around character that does off-field dps.
    With his passive, E heals Kaeya for 15% of his atk.
    With another passive, freezing opponents with E can generate up to 2 extra particles.
  </p>
  <p>C1 increases NA/CA crit rate by 15% against opponents affected by cryo.
    C2 get extend Q duration from 8s to 15s (extends 2.5s for each opponent defeated during Q).
    C4 creates shield when Kaeya's hp falls below 20% lasting 20s (cd 60s).
    C6 makes Q create 1 more icicle and restore 15 energy.
  </p><p>
    The C4 is a destruction / preservation kind of constellation, similar to Xiao's C4 buffing defense.
    The passive that allows Kaeya to heal himself with E also gives him additional survivability.
  </p>

  <h2>Build</h2>
  <p>Can use 4p blizzard, 4p noblesse, 4p emblem, and mixed sets.</p>

  <h2>Teams</h2>
  <p>Kaeya is usually used on quickswap melt/freeze teams.
    For example, Dehya-Kaeya-Rosaria-Bennett or Kaeya-Chongyun-Yelan-Anemo.
    He can be played as a physical carry given his high NA scalings:
    Kaeya-Mika-Electro.
    He can also be paired alongside Eula or Ayaka.
  </p><p>
    There is the Kaeluc team (Diluc melt team):
    Diluc-Kaeya-Bennett-Anemo (Sucrose, etc.).
  </p>

  <h2>Calculations</h2>
  <p>As Kaeya is one of the starter characters alongside Amber and Lisa,
    it may take a longer time to get c6 Kaeya.
    But here we still assume lv13 E and Q.
    Also assume 4p blizzard strayer for 61.6% cryo dmg. 
  </p><p>
    At lv13 E has 406.3% scaling and 6s cd. The mv is
    $$x_e = 1.616*406.3/6 = 109.4301333333$$
