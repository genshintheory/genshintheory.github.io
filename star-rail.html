<title>Honkai: Star Rail</title>

  </head>
  
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  <p>Honkai Star Rail (星穹铁道) is a new Honkai game that released in 2023,
    developed by the same creators of Genshin.
    Honkai (崩坏) refers to a cataclysm type event (cf. cataclysm in Genshin).
    There is a lot of overlap between Star Rail and previous Honkai games.
    But there is also overlap between Honkai and Genshin.
  </p><p>
    Like Genshin, Star Rail has a gacha system with limited event characters.
    Unlike Genshin, Star Rail has a turn-based combat system (like many Final Fantasy games).
  </p>


  <h2>Characters</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Trailblazer (Stelle / Caelus): 'resurrected' by Silver Wolf and Kafka with Stellaron on Herta's space station.</li>
    <li>March 7th: a cryo bow shielder (like Diona), game mascot (like Paimon of Genshin), 
      was found in a block of six-phased ice in space, does not remember her original name or where she's from.
    </li>
    <li>Himeko: a character from previous Honkai games, resurrected.</li>
    <li>hook (huke): the Klee of Star Rail, a pyro child, father is Fersman.</li>
    <li>bailu: the baizhu of Star Rail, a medic healer</li>
    <li>Dan Heng (丹恒): a wind character, has an ultimate reminiscent of Kazuha's, 
      contains the character 丹 also found in the name of Kazuha's ancestor <a href='niwa.html'>Niwa</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Aeons are the equivalent of Archons and are the leaders of the different paths.</p>


  <h2>Enemies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Anti-matter legion: baryons, anti-baryons, etc. get to fight things from particle physics</li>
    <li>The mara-struck look like clicker zombies from Last of Us.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>World</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Jarilo-VI: the Mondstadt/Snezhnaya of Star Rail, but based more on Slavic culture rather than German</li>
    <li>Xianzhou Luofu: the Liyue of Star Rail</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Star Rail invited 2019 Nobel Physics Prize winner Didier Queloz to talk about astronomy in Galactic Rhapsody.
    Not bad. Not bad.
  </p>


  <h2>Combat</h2>
  <p>
    Characters can be equipped with weapons (light cones of different paths),
    artifacts (relics),
    and can level up their talents (via a trace tree).
  </p>
  <p>Eidolons are like constellations. There are 6 of them for a character.</p>
  <p>Characters have elements and can deal elemental damage.</p>
  <p>Trailblazer power is like resin.
    Warps are like wishes.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the start of battle, the team shares 3 skill points (can be 4 with certain relics).
    Basic attacks increase the number of skill points (up to 5).
    Using skills will consume skill points.
    Energy is charged when using basic attacks, skills, or being attacked by enemies.
    When energy is full, ultimates can be used.
    While outside of battle, techniques can be used for buffs before entering battle.
  </p>

  <p>As a turn-based game, Star Rail offers automatic-combat,
    where the player can just sit back, look at the screen, and do nothing
    while the game picks moves for the characters.
    There is even a fast-forward button.
    This streamlines the process of clearing the equivalent of ley line deposits.
  </p><p>
    The order of events is determined by <a href='hsr-speed.html'>speed</a> and action value.
  </p>

  <p>
    The system involving elements and enemy weaknesses is a bit different from Genshin's combat system.
    Enemies have elemental weakness, but there is currently not much about elemental reactions or resonance.
    And some elements like water/hydro are missing or have been replaced by other elements lke quantum, imaginary, etc.
    Enemies will start with a toughness bar in addition to hp.
    Toughness is like the armor on Fatui Skirmishers.
    Using the appropriate element can deplete toughness to 0, applying a weakness break to the enemy.
    In this state, the enemy can suffer from different elemental effects 
    and will be in a disabled state where they will not be able to attack.
  </p><p>
    Currently, there is not much difference between different elements,
    unlike in Genshin, where each element almost takes on a life of their own.
    Even when it comes to break effects such as fire dot, ice dot, entanglement, etc. 
    Genshin appears to have much more variation.
  </p>

  <p>The path system is a bit different from Genshin.
    Paths are like character roles (dps, buffer, healer, etc.).
    Each character belongs to a path.
  </p><p>
    Light cones provide stat buffs to characters.
    And if the light cone matches the path of the character, 
    they can provide additional passive abilities.
    They function like weapons in star rail.
    Technically, a character can use any light cone (even if the path does not match).
    But to activate the light cone passive, the path needs to match.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this game, the distinction between single target and aoe is more explicitly stated.
    For example, Erudition is specifically for aoe dps characters like Himeko or Jing Yuan.
    And the Hunt is specifically for single target dps characters like Seele, Yanqing, or hu tao.
  </p><p>
    There are different types of aoe:
    there is blast (hits one enemy and adjacent targets), bounce, and aoe (hits everyone).
    Of these, only aoe (hitting everyone) has a different <a href='scaling.html'>scaling law</a>.
    Blast and bounce still technically have the same scaling as single target (sublinear).
    It is just the constant in the scaling law that may be higher for bounce and blast.
  </p>

  <p>In Star Rail, healers become much more important (than in Genshin) given that one cannot dodge attacks.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Memory of Chaos (MOC, Forgotten Hall) appears to be the equivalent of the Spiral Abyss.
    But Star Rail also has another form of end-game content: the Simulated Universe (SU).
    Having something like Simulated Universe that resets weekly and gives primogems in Genshin would be a fantastic idea.
  </p>


  <h2>Story</h2>
  <p>The game opens with the Stellaron hunters Kafka and Silver Wolf entering the Hertha space station
    while it is being attacked by the antimatter legion.
    They place a stellaron into the trailblazer's body.
    The trailblazer wakes up to find Dan Heng and March 7th.
    They join Himeko to defeat the Doomsday Beast.
    They then meet Herta who introduces them to the simulated universe (an end game dungeon that resets weekly).
    They then meet Pom-Pom and travel on the Astral Express to their first planet: Jarilo-VI,
    a world covered in ice since the Eternal Freeze that struck it 700 years ago.
    (Note there is an alternate eneding where the trailblazer does not join the Astral Express but stays to be experimented on by Herta).
  </p><p>
    After clearing Jarilo-VI, meeting Seele and Bronya, and defeating Cocolia,
    the trailblazer travels to the Xianzhou Luofu.
    There they meet Jing Yuan, Fu Xuan, Sushang, Luocha, Blade, and others.
    With Fu Xuan's help they capture Kafka.
    They also defeat a 'deer friend'. 
  </p><p>
    Stellarons are tumors of worlds, harbingers of destruction, cancers of civilization.
    They cause chaos to whatever planet they go to, creating ecological and environmental damage,
    as well as crytallizations of fragmentum,
    which spawn corrupted enemies.
  </p>


  <h2>Play Genshin or Honkai first?</h2>
  <p>Although the Honkai games came first (and influenced Genshin),
    Genshin is a larger game with a sprawling interconnected world map and more dynamic combat system.
    Genshin is akin to a magnum opus.
    Its reach and community is much larger and broader globally.
    And now Genshin is returning the favor by influencing the Honkai series through Star Rail,
    whether through character design, combat design, progression system, etc.
    It is not like much will be lost if one plays Genshin before the Honkai games.
    If anything, with Honkai's lore largely established and Genshin's lore still developing,
    Honkai can provide hints at certain elements of Genshin's story.
  </p><p>
    Still, it is recommended to play Genshin first.
    It is just a bigger game with a larger scope.
  </p><p>
    In Star Rail, the character cannot jump or glide.
    It is basically a '2d game'.
    Genshin offers a '3d experience'.
