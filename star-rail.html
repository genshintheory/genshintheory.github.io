<title>Honkai: Star Rail</title>

  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  <p>Honkai Star Rail (星穹铁道), abbreviated HSR, is a new Honkai game that released in 2023,
    developed by the same creators of Genshin.
    Honkai (崩坏) refers to a cataclysm type event (cf. cataclysm in Genshin).
    There is a lot of overlap between Star Rail and previous Honkai games.
    But there is also overlap between Honkai and Genshin.
  </p><p>
    Like Genshin, Star Rail has a gacha system with limited event characters.
    Unlike Genshin, Star Rail has a turn-based combat system (like many Final Fantasy and Pokemon games).

  <h2>Enemies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Anti-matter legion: baryons, anti-baryons, etc. get to fight things from particle physics</li>
    <li>The mara-struck look like clicker zombies from Last of Us.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>World: Universe, Astrophysics, Cosmology</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Jarilo-VI: the Mondstadt/Snezhnaya of Star Rail, but based more on Slavic culture rather than German.
      The world was in the midst of a snowstorm for 700 years known as the Eternal Freeze caused by a Stellaron.
      After the trailblazer defeats Cocolia (18th Supreme Guardian of Belobog), who harnessed the Stellaron's power,
      and contains the Stellaron's energy, the planet has hope to return to normal.
    </li>
    <li>Xianzhou Luofu: the Liyue of Star Rail.
      It is one of the civilizations that were able to convert their planet into a spaceship that can travel through the galaxies.
      This is akin to what is done in the Wandering Earth series by Liu Cixin,
      where humanity turns their own Earth into a spaceship to escape the expanding Sun.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Star Rail invited 2019 Nobel Physics Prize winner Didier Queloz to talk about astronomy in Galactic Rhapsody.
    Not bad. Not bad.
    Details on topics discussed are in <a href='hsr-universe.html'>HSR universe</a>.
  </p>


  <h2>Combat</h2>
  <p>
    Characters can be equipped with weapons (light cones of different paths),
    artifacts (relics),
    and can level up their talents (via a trace tree).
  </p>
  <p>Eidolons are like constellations. There are 6 of them for a character.</p>
  <p>Characters have elements and can deal elemental damage.</p>
  <p>Trailblazer power is like resin.
    Warps are like wishes.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the start of battle, the team shares 3 skill points (can be 4 with certain relics).
    Basic attacks increase the number of skill points (up to 5).
    Using skills will consume skill points.
    Energy is charged when using basic attacks, skills, or being attacked by enemies.
    When energy is full, ultimates can be used.
    While outside of battle, techniques can be used for buffs before entering battle.
  </p>

  <p>As a turn-based game, Star Rail offers automatic-combat,
    where the player can just sit back, look at the screen, and do nothing
    while the game picks moves for the characters.
    There is even a fast-forward button.
    This streamlines the process of clearing the equivalent of ley line deposits.
  </p><p>
    The order of events is determined by <a href='hsr-speed.html'>speed</a> and action value.
  </p>

  <h3>Elements</h3>
  <p>
    The system involving elements and enemy weaknesses is a bit different from Genshin's combat system.
    Enemies have elemental weakness, but there is currently not much about elemental reactions or resonance.
    And some elements like water/hydro are missing or have been replaced by other elements lke quantum, imaginary, etc.
    Enemies will start with a toughness bar in addition to hp.
    Toughness is like the armor on Fatui Skirmishers.
    Using the appropriate element can deplete toughness to 0, applying a weakness break to the enemy.
    In this state, the enemy can suffer from different elemental effects 
    and will be in a disabled state where they will not be able to attack.
  </p><p>
    Currently, there is not much difference between different elements,
    unlike in Genshin, where each element almost takes on a life of their own.
    Even when it comes to break effects such as fire dot, ice dot, entanglement, etc. 
    Genshin appears to have much more variation.
  </p>

  <h3>Paths</h3>
  <p>The path system is a bit different from Genshin.
    Paths are like character roles (dps, buffer, healer, etc.), archetypes, or functions.
    Each character belongs to a path.
    The paths include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Erudition: aoe dps</li>
    <li>Harmony: buffs team</li>
    <li>Nihility: debuffs enemy</li>
    <li>Hunt: single-target dps</li>    
    <li>Abundance: healer</li>
    <li>Preservation: defense (e.g. shielder)</li>
    <li>Destruction: 'survivability' (a kind of generalist/tank that can deal damage too, both single/multi-target)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Leading examples include Seele (hunt), Jing Yuan (erudition), Silver Wolf (nihility).
    Of the above, erudition, destruction, and hunt are designed to do damage (dps/carries),
    whereas harmony, nihility, abundance, preservation have more supportive roles.
  </p><p>
    Of course, some characters can have overlap in function (can have abilities matching several different paths).
    But in HSR, each character belongs to one and only one path.
  </p>

  <p>
    If one applies this system to Genshin, it would look something like this:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Erudition (most dps/subdps): Xiao, Diluc, Raiden, ganyu, Cyno, Alhaitham, Childe, Eula, Ayaka, Wanderer, ayato, Nilou, klee, 
      Noelle, Yanfei, Heizou, Xiangling
    </li>
    <li>Harmony: Bennett, Mona, Yun Jin, 
      kazuha, Sucrose, Nahida (EM buff), Raiden (energy),
      Gorou, Shenhe, Faruzan, Sara, Mika,       
      any unit via instructor / noblesse
    </li>
    <li>Hunt: Yoimiya, Yelan, Keqing (Alhaitham has more aoe because of mirrors), hu tao, Xingqiu, ningguang, razor
    </li>
    <li>Preservation: zhongli, Diona, Xinyan, baizhu, Layla, Thoma, Kirara, Noelle, Yanfei c4, Beidou c1</li>
    <li>Abundance: Jean, Bennett, Diona, baizhu, Kuki, Qiqi, Barbara, Kokomi, Yaoyao, Noelle, Mika</li>
    <li>Nihility (includes res/def shred): 
      VV anemo units, Faruzan, Morax, lisa (def shred), Nahida (c2), Eula (E res shred), Qiqi (c4, reduce enemy atk),
      anemo crowd control units,
      superconduct units, any unit via deepwood
    </li>
    <li>Destruction (dps with self-sacrifice mechanism or built-in durability/self-healing/self-shielding): 
      Xiao, Itto, Dehya, hu tao, Noelle, Yanfei c4 (tankfei), Beidou c1
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Vacuum abilities such as Venti's crowd-control can count as part of nihility as they can disable enemy movement, 
    similar to what Mr. Yang (Imaginary) can do by trapping the enemy.
    In such a case, taunts like Amber's bunny or Mona's mirror may also be counted as nihility for impeding enemy movement.
    Crowd-control, freezing, imprisonment, petrification can count as types of debuffs that negatively impact the enemy.
  </p><p>
    Other things like Chongyun's infusion are also a bit more unique than what the HSR path system provides.
    They are in a class of their own, not really falling into any of the above paths.
  </p><p>
    To illustrate the multi-tasking ability of some characters: 
    Noelle fits erudition, preservation, and abundance.
    Bennett fits harmony and abundance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, in HSR, there is not really any 'off-field dps' (like Dehya, Nahida, Albedo, Yae) as all the characters are on-field.
    However, there are characters that can do coordinated attacks with other characters like Tingyun, March, etc.
    Moreover, sometimes the term 'subdps' is still used for team-building in HSR
    (meaning another dps that complements the 'main dps').
  </p>
  <p>In Star Rail, healers become much more important (than in Genshin) given that one cannot dodge attacks.
    But once one gets Natasha, there is no need to get another healer.
    For MOC, one can just use Natasha one side and then a preservation unit / shielder like March on the other.
  </p>


  <h3>Weapons (Lightcones)</h3>
  <p>
    Light cones (LC) provide stat buffs to characters.
    And if the light cone matches the path of the character, 
    they can provide additional passive abilities.
    They function like weapons in star rail.
    Technically, a character can use any light cone (even if the path does not match).
    But to activate the light cone passive, the path needs to match.
  </p><p>
    In Genshin, the 'weapons' are classified by weapon-type, whereas in HSR they are classified by path (and are called lightcones).
    As can be seen in HSR, characters can wield all kinds of different weapons, including guns (Bronya).
  </p>


  <h3>AoE</h3>
  <p>
    In this game, the distinction between single target and aoe is more explicitly stated.
    For example, Erudition is specifically for aoe dps characters like Himeko or Jing Yuan.
    And the Hunt is specifically for single target dps characters like Seele, Yanqing, or hu tao.
  </p><p>
    There are different types of aoe:
    there is blast (hits one enemy and adjacent targets), bounce, and aoe (hits everyone).
    Of these, only aoe (hitting everyone) has a different <a href='scaling.html'>scaling law</a>.
    Blast and bounce still technically have the same scaling as single target (sublinear).
    It is just the constant in the scaling law that may be higher for bounce and blast.
  </p>  

  <h3>Aggro, Taunt</h3>
  <p>
    Enemies will probabilistically attack characters based on their taunt values (aggro).
    The higher the taunt value the more likely the target will be attacked.
    Based on experimentation, the taunt value of a character is fixed depending on their path.
    So all characters in one path have the same taunt value.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Erudition, Hunt: 75</li>
    <li>Harmony, Nihility, Abundance: 100</li>
    <li>Destruction: 125</li>
    <li>Preservation: 150</li>    
  </ul>
  <p>Intuitively, preservation and destruction possess the highest survivability among paths,
    so they are the ones who get attacked more often.
  </p><p>
    Some abilities in the game can taunt and modify aggro value,
    such as the preservation trailblazer's skill and certain enemy abilities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hypothesis:
    A simple model for calculating the probability a character is attacked is:
    $$p_i = T_i / \sum_j T_j$$
    where \(T_i \) is the taunt value of character i, the denominator is the sum of taunt values over the team,
    and \(p_i \) is the probability that character i is attacked.
  </p><p>
    However, it is currently not known if HSR uses the above formula for actually calculating the probability.
    It is possible another system or formula is used.
    TBD after further experimentation.
  </p>


  <h3>Endgame</h3>
  <p>
    The Memory of Chaos (MOC, Forgotten Hall) appears to be the equivalent of the Spiral Abyss.
    But Star Rail also has another form of end-game content: the Simulated Universe (SU).
    Having something like Simulated Universe that resets weekly and gives primogems in Genshin would be a fantastic idea.
  </p>


  <h2>Story</h2>
  <p>The game opens with the Stellaron hunters Kafka and Silver Wolf entering the Hertha space station
    while it is being attacked by the antimatter legion.
    They place a stellaron into the trailblazer's body.
    The trailblazer wakes up to find Dan Heng and March 7th.
    They join Himeko to defeat the Doomsday Beast.
    The trailblazer encounters the aeon of destruction (Nanook).
    They meet Herta who introduces them to the simulated universe (an end game dungeon that resets weekly).
    They then meet Pom-Pom and travel on the Astral Express to their first planet: Jarilo-VI,
    a world covered in ice since the Eternal Freeze that struck it 700 years ago.
    Their mission is to locate and destroy the stellaron on the planet.
    (Note there is an alternate ending where the trailblazer does not join the Astral Express but stays to be experimented on by Herta).
  </p>
  <p>In Jarilo-VI, the trailblazer meets Cocolia (ruler of Belebog) and her daughter Bronya.
    Cocolia sends guards to arrest the trailblazer, March, and Dan.
    They are rescued by Sampo, who takes them to the underworld.
    There they meet Seele, Natasha, Oleg and learn more about the stellaron from Svarog.
    Bronya then confronts her mother Cocolia on the truth about the stellaron.
    The trailblazer heads back to the overworld to find the stellaron.
    With Serval's help, they pass through the silvermane soldier frontline and head into the winter storm.
    There they catch up with Cocolia, who is trying to indoctrinate Bronya.
    They battle Cocolia and a giant guardian robot.
    The trailblazer encounters the aeon of preservation (Qlipoth). 
    It is revealed that Cocolia was possessed by the stellaron this whole time.
    They defeat Cocolia, and she dies.
    The stellaron is cleared from the world, but the fragmentum is deep-rooted into the ecosystem.
    It will take time for Jarilo to recover fully.
  </p>
  <p>
    After clearing Jarilo-VI, the trailblazer travels to the Xianzhou Luofu.
    There they meet Jing Yuan, Fu Xuan, Sushang, Luocha, Blade, and others.
    With Fu Xuan's help they capture Kafka.
    They also defeat a 'deer friend'. 
  </p><p>
    Stellarons are tumors of worlds, harbingers of destruction, cancers of civilization.
    They cause chaos to whatever planet they go to, creating ecological and environmental damage,
    as well as crytallizations of fragmentum, which spawn corrupted enemies.
  </p>


  <h2>Version content</h2>
  <h3>Version 1.1</h3>
  <p>In the starhunt game, Silver Wolf's (SW) companion mission is featured.
    In their story quest, we learn that the CIA, their puppets, kaveh, wei, li cannot win all the time.
    In fact it is better if they lose.
  </p><p>
    The 4 star LC from the version 1.1 event increases SW's effect hit rate.
  </p><p>
    In the Belebog museum event, we meet Pela, Swetta, which reminds one of two people who recently got fired for unprofessionalism.
    Interestingly, in this event Norbert is the villain and thief that gets caught and arrested.
    It seems that political sentiments have evolved quite a bit in the past year,
    where we went from yoshinori as kazuha's ancestor to murdering niwa to making Norbert the villain.
  </p>


  <h2>Play Genshin or Honkai first?</h2>
  <p>Although the Honkai games came first (and influenced Genshin),
    Genshin is a larger game with a sprawling interconnected world map and more dynamic combat system.
    Genshin is akin to a magnum opus.
    Its reach and community are much larger and broader globally.
    And now Genshin is returning the favor by influencing the Honkai series through Star Rail,
    whether through character design, combat design, progression system, etc.
    It is not like much will be lost if one plays Genshin before the Honkai games.
    If anything, with Honkai's lore largely established and Genshin's lore still developing,
    Honkai can provide hints at certain elements of Genshin's story.
  </p><p>
    Still, it is recommended to play Genshin first.
    It is just a bigger game with a larger scope.
  </p><p>
    In Star Rail, the character cannot jump or glide.
    It is basically a '2d game'.
    Genshin offers a '3d experience'.

  <h3>Pending</h3>
  <p>pending: Svarog, Gepard Landau, Luocha</p>

  <p>Luocha's placement will be inversely proportional to how much the USA CIA shills for him.
    It will also be proportional to how well Honkai has treated Seele, Jing Yuan, Silver Wolf from 2022-2023 and onwards.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gepard: Ma is a victim of Li Hao, Yang is a victim of Li Yuan, another part of his design is a victim of Li Yu, 
    Lan is a victim of Zhu Yuanzhang. The Jie people lived in Siberia and founded some dynasties in North China.
    So HSR managed to design a character smearing and attacking the li family.
  </p><p>
    Clara / Svarog: Sun is a victim of Lin Shuangwen (who initiated a failed rebellion in China), 
    another va is a victim of Li Yu, Cai is a victim of Li Hao.
    Shi (史) is part of the name of someone who rebelled against the Tang and as someone who fought in the Mongol Yuan armies.
    So this is another character that smears the li family.
    Maybe someone did not study enough history? They are not the only ones with long-term memory.

    All of this will be factored when evaluating their placement.
