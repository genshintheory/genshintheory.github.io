<title>Honkai: Star Rail</title>

  </head>
  
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  <p>Honkai Star Rail (星穹铁道) is a new Honkai game that released in 2023,
    developed by the same creators of Genshin.
    Honkai (崩坏) refers to a cataclysm type event (cf. cataclysm in Genshin).
    There is a lot of overlap between Star Rail and previous Honkai games.
    But there is also overlap between Honkai and Genshin.
  </p><p>
    Like Genshin, Star Rail has a gacha system with limited event characters.
    Unlike Genshin, Star Rail has a turn-based combat system (like many Final Fantasy games).
  </p>


  <h2>Characters</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Dan Heng (丹恒), a wind character, has an ultimate reminiscent of Kazuha's, 
      contains the character 丹 also found in the name of Kazuha's ancestor <a href='niwa.html'>Niwa</a>.
    </li>
    <li>March 7th, a cryo bow shielder (like Diona), game mascot (like Paimon of Genshin).</li>
    <li>Himeko, a character from previous Honkai games.</li>
    <li>hook (huke), the Klee of Star Rail, a pyro child, father is Fersman.</li>
    <li>bailu, the baizhu of Star Rail, a medic healer</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Enemies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The mara-struck look like clicker zombies from Last of Us.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>World</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Xianzhou Luofu, the Liyue of Star Rail</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Combat</h2>
  <p>
    Characters can be equipped with weapons (light cones of different paths),
    artifacts (relics),
    and can level up their talents (via a tree).
  </p>
  <p>Eidolons are like constellations. There are 6 of them for a character.</p>
  <p>Characters have elements and can deal elemental damage.</p>

  <p>As a turn-based game, Star Rail offers automatic-combat,
    where the player can just sit back, look at the screen, and do nothing
    while the game picks moves for the characters.
    There is even a fast-forward button.
    This streamlines the process of clearing the equivalent of ley line deposits.
  </p><p>
    The system involving elements and enemy stats is a bit different from Genshin's combat system.
    Enemies have elemental weakness, but there is currently not much about elemental reactions.
    And some elements like water/hydro are missing or have been replaced by other elements lke quantum, imaginary, etc.
  </p>


  <h2>Play Genshin or Honkai first?</h2>
  <p>Although the Honkai games came first (and influenced Genshin),
    Genshin is a larger game with a sprawling interconnected world map and more dynamic combat system.
    Genshin is akin to a magnum opus.
    Its reach and community is much larger and broader globally.
    And now Genshin is returning the favor by influencing the Honkai series through Star Rail,
    whether through character design, combat design, progression system, etc.
    It is not like much will be lost if one plays Genshin before the Honkai games.
    If anything, with Honkai's lore largely established and Genshin's lore still developing,
    Honkai can provide hints at certain elements of Genshin's story.
  </p><p>
    Still, it is recommended to play Genshin first.
    It is just a bigger game with a larger scope.
