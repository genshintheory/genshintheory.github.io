  <h2>Characters</h2>
  <p>Kaeya, Dainsleif, the Alberich family are from here (including Clothar Alberich/Eide, founder of the Abyss)

    It is also referred to as Dahri in the Sumeru desert (see the quest with Sorush).
  </p>

  <p>According to Wanderer's stories, puppetry originated from Khaenriah.
    In real life, puppetry originated from Greece.
    So Khaenriah may be a reference to ancient Greece.
    Enkanomiya contains many references to Khaenriah people, many of whom have Greek-sounding names.
  </p>

  <p>Khaenriah was allegedly destroyed in the cataclysm 500 years ago.
    In real life, Byzantine Greece was conquered by the Ottoman Turks around 500 years ago too.
    This may be overanalyzing, but it is just to play around.
