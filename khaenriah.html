  <p>Kaeya, Dainsleif, the Alberich family are from here (including Clothar Alberich/Eide, founder of the Abyss)

    It is also referred to as Dahri in the Sumeru desert (see the quest with Sorush).
  </p>

  <p>According to Wanderer's stories, puppetry originated from Khaenriah.
    In real life, puppetry originated from Greece.
    So Khaenriah may be a reference to ancient Greece.
    Enkanomiya contains many references to Khaenriah people, many of whom have Greek-sounding names.
  </p>

  <p>Khaenriah was allegedly destroyed in the cataclysm 500 years ago.
    In real life, Byzantine Greece was conquered by the Ottoman Turks around 500 years ago too.
    This may be overanalyzing, but it is just to play around.
  </p>


  <h2>How advanced was Ancient Greece in science?</h2>
  <p>Khaenriah was a very advanced civilization.
    Ancient Greece, by the time of Alexander, was also very advanced.
    Axiomatic reasoning used in mathematics was invented in Greece, in the book Euclid's elements.
    Classical geometric results were discovered in Greece.
    China has been using the same written number system since the Han dynasty.
    The concepts of zero and negative numbers were known in China since the Han dynasty too.
  </p><p>
    The modern Indian-Arabic positional number system, including zero, 
    was invented around the 6th and 7th centuries during the Gupta empire.
    The Arab mathematician Al-Kindi introduced the number system to the Middle East.
    This Islamic scholars were well aware of the works of Euclid and other ancient Greek scientists.
    The Persian mathematician Al-Khwarizmi invented algebra, the concept of using unknowns to solve equations.
    This coincided with developments in algebra during the Song and Yuan dynasties.
    The number system then spread west through the Middle East to Europe.
    Then Europe had a renaissance from the 15th to 16th centuries, 
    taking the number system, algebra, and axiomatic reasoning of Euclid,
    to develop much of modern mathematics, including calculus (Newton).
    From there, modern math, physics, science exploded and advanced rapidly in a period of a few hundred years.
  </p><p>
    But the history of math can roughly be categorized in three eras:
    the ancient Greek era when Euclid's Elements appeared,
    the time between the Han and Yuan (Mongol) dynasties when the modern number system and algebra were invented and spread around the world,
    the time after the Mongol empire when Europe invented much of modern mathematics.
  </p><p>
    What math needed was a notation for numbers, a notation for solving equations (algebra), and then a system of reasoning (Euclid),
    and that provides the foundation of much of mathematics.
    Euclid was way ahead of his time. During Euclid's day, Greece did not have much of a positional number system 
    (and seemed opposed to the idea of zero, see Zeno's paradoxes).
    To understand the need for a positional number system, there are different ways to write numbers.
    One can write out the word 'eight'. 
    One can use something like the Roman system and write VIII (which is a bit of an upgrade as there is more organization).
    Or one can adopt a positional number system and write 8. 
    Similarly, one can write 'eighty-five', LXXXV, or 85.
    Now how would one write 'eighty' using numbers? One needs the concept of zero to write 80.
    So something like numbers are not as trivial as they appear. 
    It took nearly 1500 years for the ideas of zero and a positional number system to spread across Eurasia.
  </p><p>
    Another question one might ask is why do we even need numbers in the first place?
    Numbers help us calculate things a lot quicker.
    If we had 150 barrels of wheat from trade and grew 250 barrels of wheat in our farms,
    how many barrels would we have in total, and would it be enough to feed our country?
    Rather than counting each barrel one by one (using sticks or something) to compute the sum,
    we can write the amounts as abstract symbol 150 + 250.
    Then taking the sum becomes a simple algorithm: just sum the digits and carry over and we get 400.
    Something that we now take for granted took a thousand years to become commonplace.
  </p><p>
    Euclid's idea was different but also profound: it was to use a logical system based on a few fundamental axioms
    to derive theorems via a sequence of permissible deductions / operations.
    This system of logic and axiomatic thinking is necessary or else one can derive anything from anything.
    It is almost a pity that during Euclid's time he could not take advantage of a positional number system or algebra
    and put that axiomatic thinking to greater use.
    This task would be done by Europeans 1500 years later, and the result is basically all of modern mathematics.
    But what Euclid was able to do in his Elements was deduce many geometric theorems without need of a number system or algebra.
    His idea of using axiomatic reasoning was 1500 years ahead of his time and is the same idea used by modern mathematicians when they create new theories.
