  <p>Kaeya, Dainsleif, the Alberich family are from here (including Clothar Alberich/Eide, founder of the Abyss)

    It is also referred to as Dahri in the Sumeru desert (see the quest with Sorush).
  </p>

  <p>According to Wanderer's stories, puppetry originated from Khaenriah.
    In real life, puppetry originated from Greece.
    So Khaenriah may be a reference to ancient Greece.
    Enkanomiya contains many references to Khaenriah people, many of whom have Greek-sounding names.
  </p>

  <p>Khaenriah was allegedly destroyed in the cataclysm 500 years ago.
    In real life, Byzantine Greece was conquered by the Ottoman Turks around 500 years ago too.
    This may be overanalyzing, but it is just to play around.
  </p>
  <p>Khaenriah was a very advanced civilization.
    Ancient Greece, by the time of Alexander, was also very advanced.
    Axiomatic reasoning used in mathematics was invented in Greece, in the book Euclid's elements.
    Classical geometric results were discovered in Greece.
    China has been using the same written number system since the Han dynasty.
    The concepts of zero and negative numbers were known in China since the Han dynasty too.
  </p><p>
    The modern Indian-Arabic positional number system, including zero, 
    was invented around the 6th and 7th centuries during the Gupta empire.
    The Arab mathematician Al-Kindi introduced the number system to the Middle East.
    This Islamic scholars were well aware of the works of Euclid and other ancient Greek scientists.
    The Persian mathematician Al-Khwarizmi invented algebra, the concept of using unknowns to solve equations.
    This coincided with developments in algebra during the Song and Yuan dynasties.
    The number system then spread west through the Middle East to Europe.
    Then Europe had a renaissance from the 15th to 16th centuries, 
    taking the number system, algebra, and axiomatic reasoning of Euclid,
    to develop much of modern mathematics, including calculus (Newton).
    From there, modern math, physics, science exploded and advanced rapidly in a period of a few hundred years.
  </p><p>
    But the history of math can roughly be categorized in three eras:
    the ancient Greek era when Euclid's Elements appeared,
    the time between the Han and Yuan (Mongol) dynasties when the modern number system and algebra were invented and spread around the world,
    the time after the Mongol empire when Europe invented much of modern mathematics.
  </p><p>
    What math needed was a notation for numbers, a notation for solving equations (algebra), and then a system of reasoning (Euclid),
    and that provides the foundation of much of mathematics.
