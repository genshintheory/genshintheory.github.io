<title>Markov Chain Effect</title>

  <h2>Scaramouche passive</h2>
  <p>Scaramouche has a passive called Gales of Reverie where the probability of activating wind arrows increases with each NA/CA hit.
    The base probability is 16% per hit.
    If a hit does not activate the wind arrows, the probability increases by 12%.
  </p><p>
    The question becomes: how does one calculate dps from this? What is the expected damage from this?
    It turns out this uses a markov chain.
    We will call such effect 'markov chain effects' (MC effect).
    The EO set from the chasm is another example of a markov chain effect.
  </p><p>
    To define the markov chain, start with the initial state 0.
    With probability .16 one can transition from 0 back to 0 (activate the wind arrow).
    With probability .84 one will transition to state 1 (with 12% increased probability to proc wind arrow).
  </p><p>
    In state 1, with probability .28 one will transition back to state 0 (activate the wind arrow, reset probability).
    With probability .72 one will transition to state 2 (with 12% increased probability to proc wind arrow).
    And so on.
  </p><p>
    From this, one can define a transition matrix P where \(P_{ij}\) is the probability of transitioning from state i to j.
    For the above this matrix looks like:
    $$P = \begin{pmatrix}
    .16 & .84 & \\
    .28 & 0 & .72 & \\
    .4 & 0 & 0 & .6 & \\
    .52 & 0 & 0 & 0 & .48 & \\
    .64 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & .36 & \\
    .76 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & .24 & \\
    .88 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & .12 \\
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 
    \end{pmatrix}$$
  </p><p>
    After 7 missed hits, the 8th hit is guaranteed to proc the wind arrow.
