<title>SR Version 1.3</title>

  </head>
  
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  
  <p>This was a pretty bad version.
    Cover art could be improved.
    Aurum translation is poor and disgusting political attack.
    The flagship event story was unenjoyable and full of political attacks too.
    Plus the 1.3 beta was horrible, giving unfair treatment, especially to Fu Xuan.
  </p>
  <p>
    The rating for this version is either B or F (definitely below A).
    Whether it is B or F depends on how bad future versions are (for both HSR and Genshin).
    For HSR, we need to collect more data points to give a comprehensive assessment of versions.
  </p>

  <p>In case people are curious how HSR versions perform on a tierlist,
    most versions so far are A tier or below.
    No version is SS tier.
    Version 1.0 is the best to date. 
    The final verdict will be announced at a later date (1.0 will either be A or S, depending on how bad future versions are).
  </p><p>
    Overall, HSR versions are worse compared to Genshin versions.
    All other versions besides 1.0 are at A, B, or even F tier.
    Again the exact ratings will be determined once we see how corrupt future versions are 
    (it has only been 4-5 versions so far, need more data).
