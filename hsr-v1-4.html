  <h2>Trailblazer quest</h2>
  <p>After encountering those IPC guards in the quest,
    some people might be wondering:
    "did I seriously fight something that has '720 degree review', 'work culture shock', 'team building' as their moves"?
  </p><p>
    The squad leader can summon a team of 4-5 IPC people at once 
    similar to how the swarm flies can summon 4-5 flies.
    This is where it is nice to have aoe and erudition units that can hit everything at once (rather than just blasts).
  </p>
  <p>Yes, when a debt, mortgage is unable to be repaid,
    when things go bankrupt or file a chapter 11, 
    the banks can take over all the assets.
    They can take over property, buildings, cars, entire corporations, other banks, and many other things.
    So this raises the question: can they take over the government, the military, entire countries, entire planets?
  </p><p>
    But then there are related questions:
    can the government take over the banks and everything else, including other countries and planets?
    Can the military take over the government and banks?
    Who is ultimately in charge then?
  </p>


  <h2>Aetherium Wars</h2>
  <p>This is like star rail combat but with the monsters.
    It has a rock-paper-scissors system like Pokemon (a primordial form of elemental reactions).
    What if star rail incorporated such a system for the different elemental types of characters?
    For example, fire on ice could deal 2x damage.
  </p>
  <p>The warp trotter does an aoe heal (abundance).
    The guard can support units (buff atk, harmony) and deal coordinated attacks.
  </p>
  <p>The trailblazer starts exploring Victory Zones with Giovanni.</p>

  <p>The IPC apparently introduced the game to Belobog,
    and in a short time many people became addicted.
  </p>
  <p>Yep, this is like Pokemon in spirit, where you can challenge other trainers and their pokemon.
    It is pokemon but with a star rail combat system.
  </p>

  <p>The mechanical fish has a firework move similar to a Magikarp's flail that does nothing.</p>

  <p>The Silvermane guards are effective against the opponents in the Cloudford Victory Zone.
    Dunn is quite sp efficient.
  </p>


  <h2>Planar Fissure</h2>
  <p>Jingliu's technique is very efficient at breaking barrels/objects in aoe for those timed challenges.</p>


  <h2>Banners</h2>
  <p>It seems we are getting double banners very early in 1.5 with Seele and Topaz.
    Moreover the entire patch got shortened by 1 week for some reason.
