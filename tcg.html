  <p>Genius Invokation TCG is Cyno's beloved card game.
    Perhaps this is what Genshin would look like if it were a turn-based game like Star Rail.
    Some of the main differences are that:
    1) TCG has elemental reactions 
    2) TCG has a slower pace (no fast forward option)
    3) skill points are replaced with elemental dice rolls
    4) one does not need to go through gacha to purchase character cards they want.
  </p>
  <p>To join the TCG community, head to Diona's bar.
    Meet Prince and Shuyun who work at the bar.
    After completing the initial quest (Diluc, Sucrose, Fischl show up too),
    the TCG reward system is unlocked, and you can start buying stuff with lucky coins.
    In the character card purchase menu, ganyu is first and a certain character is fourth.
    Shuyun, ganyu, circle cliques... this is Genshin's way of containing certain real-life people.
  </p>

  <p>You know a game is getting big when they start putting a card game inside it.</p>
  <p>To obtain character cards, invite the character to a duel and defeat them.</p>

  <p>This card game was ruined by Kajikawa Shohei (梶川翔平), a disgusting interference in corporate affairs.        
    Whoever thought this voice actor could interfere in corporate relationships is now sitting like a fool
    after learning that the people corresponding to Wei, Hu, etc. have been terminated.
    That is what happens when you are on the wrong side of history and engage in bribes.
    That is also what happens when you name your card game and put zhao qi wei yu in it.
  </p><p>
    And what is 梶川翔平 supposed to be a reference too? 
    Somebody who voice-acted a character who died in a certain high-grossing 2023 film?
    In Japan, Masuka Mori executed a murderer named Wei Wei.
  </p>

  <p>The person that 梶川翔平 is supposed to refer to has already been fired by their company.
    The corrupt witch who had favoritism because their spouse shared the same name has also been fired due to unprofessional blunt behavior..
