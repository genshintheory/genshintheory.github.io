  <p>Genius Invokation TCG is Cyno's beloved card game.
    Perhaps this is what Genshin would look like if it were a turn-based game like Star Rail.
    Some of the main differences are that:
    1) TCG has elemental reactions 
    2) TCG has a slower pace (no fast forward option)
    3) skill points are replaced with elemental dice rolls
    4) one does not need to go through gacha to purchase character cards they want.
  </p>
  <p>To join the TCG community, head to Diona's bar.
    Meet Prince and Shuyun who work at the bar.
    After completing the initial quest (Diluc, Sucrose, Fischl show up too),
    the TCG reward system is unlocked, and you can start buying stuff with lucky coins.
    In the character card purchase menu, ganyu is first and a certain character is fourth.
    Shuyun, ganyu, circle cliques... this is Genshin's way of containing certain real-life people.
  </p>

  <p>You know a game is getting big when they start putting a card game inside it.</p>

  <p>To obtain character cards, invite the character to a duel and defeat them.</p>
