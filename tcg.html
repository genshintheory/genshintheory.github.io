    <title>Genius Invokation</title>

  <p>Genius Invokation TCG is Cyno's beloved card game.
    Perhaps this is what Genshin would look like if it were a turn-based game like Star Rail.
    Some of the main differences are that:
    1) TCG has elemental reactions 
    2) TCG has a slower pace (no fast forward option)
    3) skill points are replaced with elemental dice rolls
    4) one does not need to go through gacha to purchase character cards they want.
  </p>
  <p>To join the TCG community, head to Diona's bar.
    Meet Prince and Shuyun who work at the bar.
    After completing the initial quest (Diluc, Sucrose, Fischl show up too),
    the TCG reward system is unlocked, and you can start buying stuff with lucky coins.
    In the character card purchase menu, ganyu is first and a certain character is fourth.
    Shuyun, ganyu, circle cliques... this is Genshin's way of containing certain real-life people.
  </p>

  <p>You know a game is getting big when they start putting a card game inside it.</p>
  <p>To obtain character cards, invite the character to a duel and defeat them.</p>


  <h2>Political cliques</h2>
  <p>This card game was ruined by Kajikawa Shohei (梶川翔平), a disgusting interference in corporate affairs.        
    Whoever thought this voice actor could interfere in corporate relationships is now sitting like a fool
    after learning that the people corresponding to Wei, Hu, etc. have been terminated.
  </p><p>
    The person that 梶川翔平 is supposed to refer to has already been fired by their company.
    The corrupt witch who had favoritism because their spouse shared the same name has also been fired due to unprofessional blunt behavior.
  </p><p>
    That is what happens when you are on the wrong side of history and engage in bribes.
    That is also what happens when you name your card game and put zhao qi wei yu in it.
  </p><p>
    And what else is 梶川翔平 supposed to be a reference too? 
    Somebody who voice-acted a character who died in a certain high-grossing 2023 film?
    In Japan, Masuka Mori executed a murderer named Wei Wei.
    Wei Pengyuan has been sentenced to death for bribery.
    Zhao Zhihong, Zhao Liping have been executed for murder.
    Li Hao murdered and raped several women.
    Wei Minzhou and Zhao Zhengyong were sentenced to life in prison for bribery and corruption.
  </p><p>
    If anything, Wei, Zhao, Li have committed more severe crimes,
    so it would make more sense for the game to highlight their crimes and use that against them.
  </p><p>
    You can't design a game based on who the USA CIA likes and does not like.
    Whose interests are you serving then?
    And it is poor culture to design a game where the only people are those supported by the CIA.
    It would be better culture to teach wei, hu, zhao, li that they cannot win all the time, that they need to lose as well.
  </p>

  <p>A list of things the game did:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>3.3 release: put zhao in the name of the game, played with ordering of ganyu and other characters, 
      put a character named shuyun in the bar with Prince
    </li>
    <li>3.4: discrimination and nerfed certain characters in beta while not doing anything to klee,
      being bribed by the singapore lee family is not a license to not punish klee
    </li>
    <li>3.6: nerfed Xingqiu (this is actually ok), add clique of characters Itto, tighnari, ayato together.
      If game has so much bias on tighnari and ayato then use those people against them.
      Maybe some people want to be put under them.
    </li>
    <li>3.7: Garvipidam</li>
  </ul>
