<title>Inazuma</title>

  <h2>Inazuma and Japan</h2>
  <p>It is pretty clear that Inazuma represents some form of Japan.
    See <a href='teyvat.html'>Teyvat</a> for more details.
    Inazuma (稲妻) is in reference to the Japanese TV series as well as a character from One Piece.
  </p>

  <h2>Ainu</h2>
  <p>Tsurumi Island is probably based on Hokkaido and Ainu culture.
    See <a href='v2-2.html'>Version 2.2</a> for more details.
  </p>

  <h2>Inazuma and the Ming dynasty</h2>
  <p>Inazuma contains several allusions to the Ming dynasty of China.
    Narukami is represented by 鸣神 which is pronounced mingshen in Chinese,
    where shen means god.
    The Raiden Shogun is called the Grand Narukami Ogosho.
    She is the archon and ruler of Narukami.
    She is the Ming Shen or the Ming God.
    The character 鸣 is different from the 明 of Ming China,
    but they are pronounced similarly.
    Genshin does this with a lot of characters.
    They like to play these kinds of homonym games.
  </p><p>
    But there is a more direct connection.
    The ideal of Inazuma is eternity or 永恒 yongheng or 永远 yongyuan.
    The character 永 yong also appears in 永乐 referring to the Yongle reign of the Ming dynasty.
    Raiden herself often talks about yongheng and yongyuan (ei'en).
    More references to the Ming are swirled into the mix.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also Yae's name 八重 is a rearrangement of 重八 Chongba,
    one of the given names of the founding emperor of the Ming dynasty.
    Both Yae and Raiden are Electro characters with 90 energy cost bursts.
    In the lore they have a pretty deep knowledge of each other.
    And both are leaders of the Narukami Island,
    Raiden as the archon and Yae as the leader of the Narukami shrine.
    Put together, if Inazuma or Narukami refers to the Ming,
    then Yae and Raiden manifest themselves as the Ming rulers.
  </p><p>
    But there is a twist.
    As with many things in Genshin, not everything corresponds 100% to reality or history.
    Indeed, in the Inazuma civil war, the Narukami faction fights against the Watatsumi army 
    led by Sangonomiya Kokomi, the pearl of Inazuma.
    The pearl is an object that has certain symbolic connections to the Ming dynasty and their emperors.
    Yet Raiden, the emperor of Narukami, fights against Sangonomiya and the island of pearls.
    This is not necessarily contradictory as even the Ming itself had civil wars in its history
    where members of the ruling house fought each other for control over the throne
    (such as during the Jingnan campaign leading to Yongle's usurpation).
  </p><p>
    The pearl also has another significance in Japanese history,
    namely the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor.
    Incidentally General Gorou (五郎) of Watatsumi can be interpreted 
    as a reference to one of Japan's WW2 generals involved with the Pearl Harbor plan,
    Isoroku Yamamoto (山本五十六).
    Besides the pearl connection, both Isoroku and Gorou have the character 五 in their name.
    The connection may seem trivial or not rigorous,
    but not everything in Genshin is blunt or direct in your face (some things are though).
  </p>

  <p>
    But going back to things not being 100% the way they appear to be,
    there is also evidence that Inazuma represents another embodiment of the Yuan dynasty again.
    This time, Raiden is the god of the Yuan, and Mingshen is only a title.
    The Kamisato estate is another embodiment of the Yuan,
    with Ayato, Ayaka, and Thoma.
    Specifically, Thoma's name in Chinese 托马 contains the character 托 tuo.
    And tuo also refers to another famous figure in Yuan history,
    Tuotuo or Toqtoa, the writer of the histories of the Song, Jin, and Liao.
    Ayato has a certain connection to the Song,
    so the fact that Ayato serves the Almighty Raiden Shogun
    and that Thomas (tuoma) tends the Kamisato estate
    gives certain credence to the theory that the Yuan is truly in power in Inazuma.
