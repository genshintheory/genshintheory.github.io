  <p>In the starhunt game, Silver Wolf's (SW) companion mission is featured.
    In their story quest, we learn that the CIA, their puppets, kaveh, wei, li cannot win all the time.
    In fact it is better if they lose.
  </p><p>
    The 4 star LC from the version 1.1 event increases SW's effect hit rate.
  </p><p>
    In the Belebog museum event, we meet Pela, Swetta, which reminds one of two people who recently got fired for unprofessionalism.
    Interestingly, in this event Norbert is the villain and thief that gets caught and arrested.
    It seems that political sentiments have evolved quite a bit in the past year,
    where we went from yoshinori as kazuha's ancestor to murdering niwa to making Norbert the villain.
  </p><p>
    The museum was established 600 years ago in honor of Alisa Rand, the first supreme guardian of Belobog.
    A meteor fragment from the invasion of the antimatter legion is one of the exhibits.
    But it was recently stolen.
    The trailblazer recovers it quickly from a hotel, but tracking down the thieves would become a longer term project.
    Meanwhile, they maintain the museum in a management minigame similar to that in v3.1 of Genshin.
