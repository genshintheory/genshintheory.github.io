  <p>People come and go like the wind. 
    Replacing Oz's voice actor was one of the best things that happened to Genshin.
    As it prevented another murder or rape case from happening,
    the people who arrested Oz's voice actor deserve to be called heroes.
  </p><p>
    Genshin did not lose anything. Fischl and Oz still have their Korean voice actors. 
    This is the result of greed and excess caused by capitalism.
    All trees need to be pruned.
    Some capitalists are like rapists. 
    In fact, the greediest capitalist would still support a rapist and murderer if it meant fattening their wallets.
    They would forsake any integrity. They would lie and cheat.
    They have no morality, only one goal and desire: profit.
    They eventually need to be cut down, arrested, and executed
    or else they will keep expanding and oppressing the people.
  </p>

  <h2>Calculations</h2>
  <p>Fischl's E summons Oz which does damage for 10s.
    The E cd is 25s.
    During the 10s duration it is possible to resummon and reposition Oz again.
    Oz will snapshot ATK buffs like Bennet's Q.
    Damage is single target.
  </p><p>
    Using Fischl's Q (energy cost 60) will reset the cd of her E.
    In practice though, without spamming her burst on cd or having enough ER,
    it is hard to have 100% uptime on Oz,
    whereas it is much easier to have 100% uptime on <a href='yaemiko.html'>Yae</a>.
  </p><p>
    Let's be optimistic and suppose Fischl can spam her burst on cooldown.
    During Oz's 10s duration, he can fire 10 shots (roughly 1 shot per second).
    We suppose that after using Fischl's Q (which takes up some field time),
    we can reset the E and summon Oz for another 10s to do 10 more shots.
    So during the 25s rotation, Oz can do 20 shots, the Q will do some damage,
    and there is also the initial summoning damage from the E.
  </p><p>
    Suppose Fischl has level 13 E and Q.
    The scaling on the E is 188.7 per shot and 245.31 upon summoning.
    The scaling on the Q is 442.
    Suppose Fischl has 61.6% electro dmg bonus.
    The mv is then
    $$x = 1.616*(442+245.31+20*188.7)/25 = 288.3790784$$
    This is lower than C0 Yae.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note this ignores the effects from certain constellations.
    C2 and C4 buff her damage based on her ATK (C4 even heals).
    And C6 extends Oz's duration by 2s and makes Oz do joint attacks (that also scale with Fischl's ATK).
