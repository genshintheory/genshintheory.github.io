<title>Elements</title>

  </head>

  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>In Teyvat there are seven elements, with each element corresponding to one of the seven nations.
    For version 1-2, there have been 6 main elements.
    It is anticipated that when Sumeru releases, Dendro will also be introduced as the seventh element.
  </p>

  <h2>Reactions</h2>
  <p>
    Reactions can be roughly classified into two types: amplifying and transformative.
    Amplifying reactions include vaporize and melt, which amplify the incoming damage.
    Vaporize and melt are also asymmetric reactions.
    In melt, when pyro is applied on cryo, it gives a base 2x multiplier.
    But if cryo is applied on pyro, it gives a base 1.5x multiplier.
    In vaporize, when pyro is applied on hydro, it gives a base 1.5x multiplier.
    But if hydro is applied on pyro, it gives a base 2x multiplier.
  </p><p>
    Transformative reactions basically do an extra instance of damage.
    When anemo is applied on to one of the 'autumn' elements (pyro hydro electro cryo),
    swirl will absorb that element and deal damage within an aoe in the corresponding elemental type, spreading its effects.
    So pyro swirl will do an extra instance of pyro damage.
    This damage scales with EM and level.
    Swirl does have an absorption priority.
    Also if there are multiple enemies close together, swirl has an aoe limit of 2 instances of damage per enemy.
    So swirl is not quadratic scaling. But it does scale higher than most other linear aoe damage.
    Most linear aoe damage scales like O(n), but swirl scales like O(2n) which is double (where n is the number of enemies).
    Even then swirl is quite broken as exemplified by Venti's burst.
    If they made swirl quadratic O(n^2) then that would almost be too broken,
    when Anemo is already considered one of the most (if not the most) broken element in the game.
  </p><p>
    Other types of transformative reactions include electro-charged (hydro+electro will do extra instances of electro damage over time and stun the enemy, as well as do some chain lightning similar to Beidou's Q),
    overloaded (pyro+electro will do another instance of pyro damage and cause an aoe explosion),
    superconduct (electro+cryo will do another instance of aoe cryo damage and reduce physical RES by -40%).
  </p><p>
    When geo is applied to an autumn element it will create a crystallize shard, giving a shield to the character
    that absorbs that particular element more effectively.
  </p><p>
    Lastly there is the frozen reaction (hydro+cryo) which can freeze some enemies (not all).
    When a blunt force is applied to a frozen target, it can trigger the 'shatter' effect, dealing physical damage.
  </p><p>
    Almost all of these reactions (amplifying or transformative) scale with the character's EM (except for frozen).
    The higher the EM, the more damage can be done or the stronger the shield (for crystallize).
    In version 1.6, transformative reactions received a buff (changing how the reactions scaled with EM).    
  </p>

  <h2>Dendro (Ëçâ)</h2>
  <p>Dendro already has a reaction: burning. This happens when pyro makes contact with a dendro object,
  like wooden shields, grass, hay, dendro slimes, etc.
  It takes a certain amount of pyro gauge units (strong 2B) to get grass burning.
  It can be thought of as a certain 'dendro shield'.
  Once the shield is broken, the grass will start burning.
  </p><p>
    A recent trailer announced that there will be two new reactions for dendro:
    bloom and catalyze.
    Bloom happens when dendro+hydro react.
    Catalyze happens when dendro+electro react.
  </p><p>
    Bloom appears to drop a green plant, similar to how crystallize drops an elemental shard.
  </p><p>
    Catalyze appears to apply some sort of effect to the enemy.
    The game devs said it combines the 'wisdom' aspect related to dendro (as Sumeru is the nation of wisdom)
    and the energy aspect of Electro.
    They say it is connected to the local history of Sumeru.
  </p>

  <h2>Elemental resonance</h2>
  <p>For certain combinations of elements among party members, the party may gain certain buffs.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Double anemo (2 anemo characters): decrease cd, increase speed</li>
    <li>Double cryo: increase crit rate</li>
    <li>Double dendro: ?</li>
    <li>Double electro: generate more energy</li>
    <li>Double geo: when shielded, -20% geo res, increase dmg bonus</li>
    <li>Double hydro: increase healing</li>
    <li>Double pyro: increase ATK</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note elemental resonance effects have changed in the past.
    For example, geo resonance was once different before version 1.3.
    It only offered dmg bonus.
    But after version 1.3, geo resonance can now reduce geo res and increase shield strength.
  </p>

  <h2>Gauge units</h2>
  <p>A gauge unit (GU) is a measure of the quantity of an element applied on a target.</p>
