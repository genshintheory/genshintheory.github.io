<title>Elements</title>

  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>In Teyvat there are seven elements, with each element corresponding to one of the seven nations.
    For version 1-2, there have been 6 main elements.
    It is anticipated that when Sumeru releases, Dendro will also be introduced as the seventh element.
  </p>

  <h2>Reactions</h2>
  <p>
    Reactions can be roughly classified into two types: amplifying and transformative.
    Amplifying reactions include vaporize and melt, which amplify the incoming damage.
    Vaporize and melt are also asymmetric reactions.
    In melt, when pyro is applied on cryo, it gives a base 2x multiplier.
    But if cryo is applied on pyro, it gives a base 1.5x multiplier.
    In vaporize, when pyro is applied on hydro, it gives a base 1.5x multiplier.
    But if hydro is applied on pyro, it gives a base 2x multiplier.
  </p><p>
    Transformative reactions basically do an extra instance of damage.
    When anemo is applied on to one of the 'autumn' elements (pyro hydro electro cryo),
    swirl will absorb that element and deal damage and apply 2B gauge units
    within an aoe in the corresponding elemental type, spreading its effects.
    So pyro swirl will do an extra instance of pyro damage.
    This damage scales with EM and level.
    Moreover it will apply strong 2B pyro (good for shield breaking).
    Swirl does have an absorption priority.
    Also if there are multiple enemies close together, swirl has an aoe limit of 2 instances of damage per enemy.
    So swirl is not quadratic scaling. But it does scale higher than most other linear aoe damage.
    Most linear aoe damage scales like O(n), but swirl scales like O(2n) which is double (where n is the number of enemies).
    Even then swirl is quite broken as exemplified by Venti's burst.
    If they made swirl quadratic \(O(n^2)\) then that would almost be too broken,
    when Anemo is already considered one of the most, if not the most broken element in the game.
  </p><p>
    Other types of transformative reactions include electro-charged (hydro+electro will do extra instances of electro damage over time and stun the enemy, as well as do some chain lightning similar to Beidou's Q),
    overloaded (pyro+electro will do another instance of pyro damage and cause an aoe explosion),
    superconduct (electro+cryo will do another instance of aoe cryo damage and reduce physical RES by -40%).
  </p><p>
    When geo is applied to an autumn element it will create a crystallize shard, giving a shield to the character
    that absorbs that particular element more effectively.
  </p><p>
    Lastly there is the frozen reaction (hydro+cryo) which can freeze some enemies (not all).
    When a blunt force is applied to a frozen target, it can trigger the 'shatter' effect, dealing physical damage.
  </p><p>
    Almost all of these reactions (amplifying or transformative) scale with the character's EM (except for frozen).
    The higher the EM, the more damage can be done or the stronger the shield (for crystallize).
    In version 1.6, transformative reactions received a buff (changing how the reactions scaled with EM).    
  </p>

  <h2>Dendro (Ëçâ)</h2>
  <p>Dendro already has a reaction: burning. This happens when pyro makes contact with a dendro object,
  like wooden shields, grass, hay, dendro slimes, etc.
  It takes a certain amount of pyro gauge units (strong 2B) to get grass burning.
  It can be thought of as a certain 'dendro shield'.
  Once the shield is broken, the grass will start burning.
  </p><p>
    Version 3.0 introduced two new reactions for dendro: bloom and catalyze.
    Bloom happens when dendro+hydro react and can enable certain tertiary reactions (3-way reactions).
    Catalyze happens when dendro+electro react.
  </p><p>
    Bloom drops a Dendro Core, similar to how crystallize drops an elemental shard.
    When pyro or electro is applied to the dendro core it will produce different effects.
    If pyro is applied (burgeon) the core will do greater aoe dendro damage.
    If electro is applied (hyperbloom) the core will produce a 'sprawling shot' that will home in and attack nearby enemies.
    If nothing is applied the dendro core will automatically deal dendro damage after a certain time.
    Similar to geo constructs, only a finite number of dendro cores can exist at a given time.
    This will prevent it from having true quadratic scaling 
    (i.e. create n cores, each of which does aoe dmg on n enemies for \(n^2\) scaling).
    Swirl also has an aoe limit (for swirl it is 2 instances of damage per enemy).
  </p><p>
    Catalyze applies the 'quicken' status to the enemy.
    This causes it to take increased dendro (spread) and electro (aggravate) damage.
    The game devs said it combines the 'wisdom' aspect related to dendro (as Sumeru is the nation of wisdom)
    and the energy aspect of Electro.
    They say it is connected to the local history of Sumeru.
  </p>

  <h3>Quicken (Additive reaction)</h3>
  <p>Applying dendro and electro puts the target in the quicken state.
    Quicken is indicated by a dual dendro-electro status.
    When dendro or electro is applied, they produce the spread and aggravate reactions (and refresh the quicken status).
    Spread and aggravate give additive dmg that scales with character level and EM.
    This bonus dmg is similar to <a href='shenhe.html'>Shenhe</a> or <a href='yunjin.html'>Yun Jin</a>'s buff.
    Whereas vaporize and melt are multiplicative reactions, spread and aggravate are additive.
    The additive dmg from spread and aggravate is given by
    $$\text{flat dmg} = \text{level multiplier}*RC*(1+\frac{5*EM}{EM+1200}+\text{reaction bonus})$$
  </p><p>
    Note additive and multiplicative reactions are affected by dmg bonus%, crit, enemy defense,
    whereas transformative reactions are not.
    However, enemy resistance can affect the dmg of all reactions.
  </p><p>
    For spread \(RC = 1.25\) and for aggravate \(RC = 1.15\).
    The level multiplier at level 90 is 1446.85.
    So if EM is 0, the flat dmg increase for spread is 1808.56,
    and the flat dmg increase for aggravate is 1663.56.
  </p><p>
    Additive dmg increase / flat dmg / base dmg is factored into dmg via the following formula
    $$(\text{ATK}*\text{scaling} + \text{flat dmg})*(1+\text{dmg bonus%})*(\text{crit multiplier})$$
  </p><p>
    The flat dmg increase has an effective scaling of
    $$\frac{\text{flat dmg}}{\text{ATK}}$$
    So it is almost like increasing the scaling to
    $$\text{effective scaling} = \text{scaling} + \frac{\text{flat dmg}}{\text{ATK}}$$
    so that the damage can be rewritten as
    $$(\text{ATK}*\text{effective scaling})*(1+\text{dmg bonus%})*(\text{crit multiplier})$$
    The increase in damage is then
    $$(\text{effective scaling}*\text{scaling}) = 1+\frac{\text{flat dmg}}{\text{ATK}*\text{scaling}}$$
  </p><p>
    If a character has say 2000 ATK (no Bennett), 
    then for spread \(1808.56/2000 \approx .90\) so the increase in effective scaling is 90%.
    For aggravate it will be less.
    As a rough approximation, the main result is that spread and aggravate can increase effective scaling by around +100% (actually less).
    If the initial scaling is 100% then this can double damage.
    If the initial scaling is 200% then this multiplies damage by 1.5.
    This is important since Bennett can buff ATK by 1.5 times,
    but using Bennett or pyro can destroy the quicken status on enemies.
    So many quicken teams will not use Bennett at all,
    but based on the above considerations, the buff from quicken can compensate for the lack of Bennett.
    This can free up Bennett for your other spiral abyss team,
    so the dendro reactions can offer flexibility and give another way to play the game.
  </p><p>
    Note that Bennett's buff and quicken's buff are not multiplicative with each other.
    They actually compete with each other.
    If you have 2000 ATK and Bennett gives 1000 extra ATK, that brings your attack to 3000.
    This will diminish the effect of the additive reaction.
    The increase in effective scaling for spread will be \(1808.56/3000 \approx .60\).
    So if the initial scaling is 100% it multiplies damage by 1.6 (whereas before it was 2 times).
  </p><p>
    The main result is that the higher the scaling, the less the buff.
    Hence things with lower scaling like normal attacks (around 100%) tend to get a bigger buff from quicken
    (and things like Yun Jin's buff).
    By contrast, things with higher scaling (like nukes) receive a smaller buff.
    However, due to standard ICD for most characters, not every dendro or electro hit will get buffed.
    Only every 3rd hit (or every 2.5s) will the hit get buffed.
    For example, for Yae's E, only 1 out of 3 E hits will trigger the aggravate reaction (and be buffed) due to ICD.
  </p><p>
    The quicken reaction has decent EM scaling.
    For 100 EM the aggravate flat dmg gets a 1.38 times multiplier.
    For 230 EM it gets a 1.8 times multiplier.
    For 500 EM it gets roughly a 2.5 times multiplier.
  </p><p>
    So for example if you have 230 EM (from Gilded Dreams), 
    then at level 90 aggravate gives \(1.8*1808 \approx 3254\) flat dmg.
    For 2000 ATK and 100% scaling, aggravate can increase damage by around 2.6 times.
    (Note for things with higher scaling, the buff is lower.)
    Compare this to the 0 EM case when the buff was around 2 times for 100% scaling.
    So Gilded's EM buff can increase damage by 30%.
    Compare this to the lowsy underwhelming deepwood set, which can only increase dendro damage by 1.2 times.
    It is clear that of the two sets, Gilded is far superior.    
  </p>

  <h2>Elemental resonance</h2>
  <p>For certain combinations of elements among party members, the party may gain certain buffs.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Double anemo (2 anemo characters): decrease cd, increase speed</li>
    <li>Double cryo: increase crit rate</li>
    <li>Double dendro: gives 50 em, when triggering first order dendro reactions (burning, bloom, quicken) increase by another 30 em,
      when triggering second order dendro reactions (hyperbloom/burgeon, aggravate/spread) increase by another 20 em.
      So one can get up to 100 em from this.
      For someone like Yae this also converts to 15% dmg bonus.
    </li>
    <li>Double electro: generate more energy when triggering electro reactions, affected by hydro for 40% less time</li>
    <li>Double geo: when shielded, -20% geo res, increase dmg bonus</li>
    <li>Double hydro: increase HP by 25%, affected by pyro for 40% less time</li>
    <li>Double pyro: increase ATK</li>
    <li>Four different elements (protective canopy): increases character res</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There is a theory that elemental resonances exemplify the 'theme' of that particular element,
    including its corresponding region and archon.
    For example, Raiden centers around regenerating energy, and Morax centers on shields.
    Anemo resonance is a bit different from the cc that Venti provides,
    but the effects of increasing speed and decreasing cooldown are more similar to what Xiao (especially C6 Xiao ignoring E cd) does.
  </p>
  <p>Note elemental resonance effects have changed in the past.
    For example, geo resonance was once different before version 1.3.
    It only offered dmg bonus.
    But after version 1.3, geo resonance can now reduce geo res (good for geo dps like Itto)
    and increase shield strength.
    Also before 3.0, hydro resonance gave more healing.
    But after 3.0, hydro resonance now increases HP.
    This is a somewhat more useful change given that several hydro characters scale off HP.
  </p><p>
    Some character skills also depend on the elemental types of party members
    and can act like 'extended resonance' effects.
    For example, Gorou's field gives more buffs the more geo characters are in the party (mono effects).
    On the other hand, characters like Yun Jin or Yelan gain buffs the more diverse the party is,
    when there are more characters of different elements (diversity effects).
  </p>

  <h2>Gauge units</h2>
  <p>A gauge unit (GU) is a measure of the quantity of an element applied on a target.
    When an element is applied on a target, usually a status will appear on the target.
    The status will decay or deplete over time, depending on how many gauge units were initially applied.
    Currently, character gauges come in 1A, 2B, and 4C applications.
    (There were rumors that Yelan's Q hydro application was 1.5 gu in beta, but currently it is 1A.)
  </p>

  <h3>Quicken status</h3>
  <p>The quicken gauge is consumed when pyro is applied (burning) or hydro is applied (bloom).
    When anemo is applied, it will do electro swirl, and when geo is applied, it will do electro crystallize.
    Gauge units are also consumed.
    When cryo is applied, it will trigger the superconduct reaction.
    The dendro and cryo status can exist simultaneously on a target.
  </p>

  <h2>ICD</h2>
  <p>There is a limit to how often an element can be applied.
    For most abilities in the game, the standard ICD is 2.5s or 3 hits.
    That is an element can be applied once every 2.5 seconds or every 3 hits of that element.
  </p><p>
    There are only a handful of abilities that may not have an ICD (or the ICD is short enough).
    These include things like Diluc's E, Xiao's plunging, most polearm charged attacks.
    In practice this means that Diluc can vaporize each E hit.
    Some characters may have ICDs that differ from 2.5s or 3 hits.
    In practice and for calculations, the ICD tends to matter for characters that rely on vaporize, melt, or quicken to deal damage.
