<title>Elements</title>

  </head>

  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>In Teyvat there are seven elements (元素), with each element corresponding to one of the seven nations.
    For versions 1-2, there have been six main elements.
    When Sumeru released in version 3, Dendro was introduced as the seventh element.
    Sometimes 'physical' is considered as an eighth element.
  </p>

  <h2>Reactions</h2>
  <p>
    Reactions can be roughly classified into two types: amplifying and transformative.
  </p><p>
    Amplifying reactions include multiplicative reactions and additive reactions.
    Multiplicative reactions such as vaporize and melt, which multiply the incoming damage.
    Vaporize and melt are also asymmetric reactions.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>In melt, when pyro is applied on cryo, it gives a base 2x multiplier.
    But if cryo is applied on pyro, it gives a base 1.5x multiplier.</li>
    <li>In vaporize, when pyro is applied on hydro, it gives a base 1.5x multiplier.
    But if hydro is applied on pyro, it gives a base 2x multiplier.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>With Dendro, there are also additive reactions: aggravate and spread, which add flat damage.
    These are also asymmetric reactions (explained in detail in the Dendro section below).
  </p>
  <p>
    Transformative reactions basically do an extra instance of damage. These include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Swirl: When anemo is applied on to one of the 'autumn' elements (pyro hydro electro cryo),
    swirl will absorb that element and deal damage and apply 2B gauge units
    within an aoe in the corresponding elemental type, spreading its effects.
    So pyro swirl will do an extra instance of pyro damage.
    This damage scales with EM and level.
    Moreover it will apply strong 2B pyro (good for shield breaking).
    Swirl does have an absorption priority.
    Also if there are multiple enemies close together, swirl has an aoe limit of 2 instances of damage per enemy.
    So swirl is not quadratic scaling. But it does scale higher than most other linear aoe damage.
    Most linear aoe damage scales like O(n), but swirl scales like O(2n) which is double (where n is the number of enemies).
    Even then swirl is quite broken as exemplified by Venti's burst.
    If they made swirl quadratic \(O(n^2)\) then that would almost be too broken,
    when Anemo is already considered one of the most, if not the most broken element in the game.</li>
    <li>Electro-charged (hydro+electro will do extra instances of electro damage over time and stun the enemy, as well as do some chain lightning similar to Beidou's Q). For electro-charged the electro and hydro status will coexist on the enemy,
  allowing for things such as 'vapeload' when pyro is applied (vaporize + overloaded).</li>
    <li>Overloaded: pyro+electro will do another instance of pyro damage and cause an aoe explosion,</li>
    <li>Superconduct: electro+cryo will do another instance of aoe cryo damage and reduce physical RES by -40%.</li>
    <li>Crystallize: when geo is applied to an autumn element it will create a crystallize shard, giving a shield to the character
    that absorbs that particular element more effectively.</li>
    <li>Lastly there is the frozen reaction (hydro+cryo) which can freeze some enemies (not all).
    When a blunt force is applied to a frozen target, it can trigger the 'shatter' effect, dealing physical damage.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The damage of transformative reactions scales with character level and EM.
    They typically do not factor in crit, defense, or dmg bonus.
    But they are affected by RES.
    By contrast, amplifying reactions can crit and factor in defense as well.
  </p><p>
    The damage formula for transformative reactions is
    $$d_t = \text{level multiplier}\times \text{reaction multiplier}\times 
    (1+16 EM / (2000+EM) + \text{reaction bonus}) \times \text{RES multiplier}$$
    The level multiplier (LM) is the base damage that depends on the level of the character proccing the reaction.
    At level 90 the LM is 1446.85.
    The reaction multiplier (RM) depends on the reaction:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hyperbloom, Burgeon = 3</li>
    <li>Bloom, Overloaded = 2</li>
    <li>Shattered = 1.5</li>
    <li>Electro-Charged = 1.2</li>
    <li>Swirl = .6</li>
    <li>Superconduct = .5</li>
    <li>Burning = .25</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Almost all of these reactions (amplifying and transformative) scale with the character's EM (except for frozen).
    The higher the EM, the more damage can be done or the stronger the shield (for crystallize).
    In version 1.6, transformative reactions received a buff (changing how the reactions scaled with EM).    
  </p>

  <h2>Dendro (草)</h2>
  <p>Since 1.0, Dendro already had a reaction: burning (dendro+pyro).
    Version 3.0 introduced two new reactions for dendro: bloom and catalyze.
    Bloom happens when dendro+hydro react and can enable certain tertiary reactions (3-way reactions).
    Catalyze happens when dendro+electro react.
  </p>
    Burning happens when pyro makes contact with a dendro object,
    like wooden shields, grass, hay, dendro slimes, etc.
    It takes a certain amount of pyro gauge units (strong 2B) to get grass burning.
    It can be thought of as a certain 'dendro shield'.
    Once the shield is broken, the grass will start burning.
    However, wooden shields and grass are also different from other dendro objects in the game
    in that they can only trigger burning but not bloom or catalyze reactions.
    If grass could trigger bloom then when it is raining, there would be way too many dendro cores.
    Some people claim that wooden shields and grass are NOT dendro,
    but still elemental sight classifies such things as dendro.
    To say they are not dendro is an idiotic and blatantly wrong way of putting it.
    Another way is to expand the concept of dendro to include things that can burn but not necessarily bloom or quicken.
  </p><p>
    Bloom drops a Dendro Core, similar to how crystallize drops an elemental shard.
    When pyro or electro is applied to the dendro core it will produce different effects.
    If pyro is applied (burgeon) the core will do greater aoe dendro damage.
    If electro is applied (hyperbloom) the core will produce a 'sprawling shot' that will home in and attack nearby enemies.
    If nothing is applied the dendro core will automatically deal dendro damage after a certain time.
    The dendro core explosion can deal damage to both player and enemy.
    Similar to geo constructs, only a finite number of dendro cores can exist at a given time.
    This will prevent it from having true quadratic scaling 
    (i.e. create n cores, each of which does aoe dmg on n enemies for \(n^2\) scaling).
    Swirl also has an aoe limit (for swirl it is 2 instances of damage per enemy).
  </p><p>
    Catalyze applies the 'quicken' status to the enemy.
    This causes it to take increased dendro (spread) and electro (aggravate) damage.
    The game devs said it combines the 'wisdom' aspect related to dendro (as Sumeru is the nation of wisdom)
    and the energy aspect of Electro.
    They say it is connected to the local history of Sumeru.
  </p>

  <h3>Quicken (Additive reaction)</h3>
  <p>Applying dendro and electro puts the target in the quicken state.
    Quicken is indicated by a dual dendro-electro status.
    When dendro or electro is applied, they produce the spread and aggravate reactions (and refresh the quicken status).
    Spread and aggravate give additive dmg that scales with character level and EM.
    This bonus dmg is similar to <a href='shenhe.html'>Shenhe</a> or <a href='yunjin.html'>Yun Jin</a>'s buff.
    Whereas vaporize and melt are multiplicative reactions, spread and aggravate are additive.
    The additive dmg from spread and aggravate is given by
    $$\text{flat dmg} = \text{level multiplier}*RC*(1+\frac{5*EM}{EM+1200}+\text{reaction bonus})$$
  </p><p>
    Note additive and multiplicative reactions are affected by dmg bonus%, crit, enemy defense,
    whereas transformative reactions are not.
    However, enemy resistance can affect the dmg of all reactions.
  </p><p>
    For spread \(RC = 1.25\) and for aggravate \(RC = 1.15\).
    The level multiplier at level 90 is 1446.85.
    So if EM is 0, the flat dmg increase for spread is 1808.56,
    and the flat dmg increase for aggravate is 1663.56.
  </p><p>
    Additive dmg increase / flat dmg / base dmg is factored into dmg via the following formula
    $$(\text{ATK}*\text{scaling} + \text{flat dmg})*(1+\text{dmg bonus%})*(\text{crit multiplier})$$
  </p><p>
    The flat dmg increase has an effective scaling of
    $$\frac{\text{flat dmg}}{\text{ATK}}$$
    So it is almost like increasing the scaling to
    $$\text{effective scaling} = \text{scaling} + \frac{\text{flat dmg}}{\text{ATK}}$$
    so that the damage can be rewritten as
    $$(\text{ATK}*\text{effective scaling})*(1+\text{dmg bonus%})*(\text{crit multiplier})$$
    The increase in damage is then
    $$\frac{\text{effective scaling}}{\text{scaling}} = 1+\frac{\text{flat dmg}}{\text{ATK}*\text{scaling}}$$
  </p><p>
    If a character has say 2000 ATK (no Bennett), 
    then for spread \(1808.56/2000 \approx .90\) so the increase in effective scaling is 90%.
    For aggravate it will be less.
    As a rough approximation, the main result is that spread and aggravate can increase effective scaling by around +100% (actually less).
    If the initial scaling is 100% then this can double damage.
    If the initial scaling is 200% then this multiplies damage by 1.5.
    This is important since Bennett can buff ATK by 1.5 times,
    but using Bennett or pyro can destroy the quicken status on enemies.
    So many quicken teams will not use Bennett at all,
    but based on the above considerations, the buff from quicken can compensate for the lack of Bennett.
    This can free up Bennett for your other spiral abyss team,
    so the dendro reactions can offer flexibility and give another way to play the game.
  </p><p>
    Note that Bennett's buff and quicken's buff are not multiplicative with each other.
    They actually compete with each other.
    If you have 2000 ATK and Bennett gives 1000 extra ATK, that brings your attack to 3000.
    This will diminish the effect of the additive reaction.
    The increase in effective scaling for spread will be \(1808.56/3000 \approx .60\).
    So if the initial scaling is 100% it multiplies damage by 1.6 (whereas before it was 2 times).
  </p><p>
    The main result is that the higher the scaling, the less the buff.
    Hence things with lower scaling like normal attacks (around 100%) tend to get a bigger buff from quicken
    (and things like Yun Jin's buff).
    By contrast, things with higher scaling (like nukes) receive a smaller buff.
    However, due to standard ICD for most characters, not every dendro or electro hit will get buffed.
    Only every 3rd hit (or every 2.5s) will the hit get buffed.
    For example, for Yae's E, only 1 out of 3 E hits will trigger the aggravate reaction (and be buffed) due to ICD.
  </p><p>
    The quicken reaction has decent EM scaling.
    For 100 EM the aggravate flat dmg gets a 1.38 times multiplier.
    For 230 EM it gets a 1.8 times multiplier.
    For 500 EM it gets roughly a 2.5 times multiplier.
  </p><p>
    So for example if you have 230 EM (from Gilded Dreams), 
    then at level 90 aggravate gives \(1.8*1808 \approx 3254\) flat dmg.
    For 2000 ATK and 100% scaling, aggravate can increase damage by around 2.6 times.
    (Note for things with higher scaling, the buff is lower.)
    Compare this to the 0 EM case when the buff was around 2 times for 100% scaling.
    So Gilded's EM buff can increase damage by 30%.
    Compare this to the lowsy underwhelming deepwood set, which can only increase dendro damage by 1.2 times.
    It is clear that of the two sets, Gilded is far superior.    
  </p>

  <h2>Elemental resonance</h2>
  <p>For certain combinations of elements among party members, the party may gain certain buffs.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Double anemo (2 anemo characters): decrease cd, increase speed</li>
    <li>Double cryo: increase crit rate</li>
    <li>Double dendro: gives 50 em, when triggering first order dendro reactions (burning, bloom, quicken) increase by another 30 em,
      when triggering second order dendro reactions (hyperbloom/burgeon, aggravate/spread) increase by another 20 em.
      So one can get up to 100 em from this.
      For someone like Yae this also converts to 15% dmg bonus.
    </li>
    <li>Double electro: generate more energy when triggering electro reactions, affected by hydro for 40% less time</li>
    <li>Double geo: when shielded, -20% geo res, increase dmg bonus</li>
    <li>Double hydro: increase HP by 25%, affected by pyro for 40% less time</li>
    <li>Double pyro: increase ATK</li>
    <li>Four different elements (protective canopy): increases character res</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There is a theory that elemental resonances exemplify the 'theme' of that particular element,
    including its corresponding region and archon.
    For example, Raiden centers around regenerating energy, and Morax centers on shields.
    Anemo resonance is a bit different from the cc that Venti provides,
    but the effects of increasing speed and decreasing cooldown are more similar to what Xiao (especially C6 Xiao ignoring E cd) does.
  </p>
  <p>Note elemental resonance effects have changed in the past.
    For example, geo resonance was once different before version 1.3.
    It only offered dmg bonus.
    But after version 1.3, geo resonance can now reduce geo res (good for geo dps like Itto)
    and increase shield strength.
    Also before 3.0, hydro resonance gave more healing.
    But after 3.0, hydro resonance now increases HP.
    This is a somewhat more useful change given that several hydro characters scale off HP.
  </p><p>
    Some character skills also depend on the elemental types of party members
    and can act like 'extended resonance' effects.
    For example, Gorou's field gives more buffs the more geo characters are in the party (mono effects).
    On the other hand, characters like Yun Jin or Yelan gain buffs the more diverse the party is,
    when there are more characters of different elements (diversity effects).
  </p>

  <h2>Gauge units</h2>
  <p>A gauge unit (GU) is a measure of the quantity of an element applied on a target.
    When an element is applied on a target, usually a status will appear on the target.
    The status will decay or deplete over time, depending on how many gauge units were initially applied.
    Currently, character gauges come in 1A, 2B, and 4C applications.
    (There were rumors that Yelan's Q hydro application was 1.5 gu in beta, but currently it is 1A.)
  </p>

  <h3>Quicken status</h3>
  <p>The quicken gauge is consumed when pyro is applied (burning) or hydro is applied (bloom).
    When anemo is applied, it will do electro swirl, and when geo is applied, it will do electro crystallize.
    Gauge units are also consumed.
    When cryo is applied, it will trigger the superconduct reaction.
    The dendro and cryo status can exist simultaneously on a target.
  </p><p>
    The quicken status is sticky.
    When you apply dendro for spread or electro for aggravate,
    it will not quickly deplete the quicken status.
    The quicken status will stick to the enemy for a while.
    As a result, the rate of dendro application does not need to be as high to consistently proc spread/aggravate.
    By contrast the 'vaporize' and 'melt' status are more ephemeral and do not last as long.
    When you trigger vape or melt, that will usually deplete the status in a few seconds 
    unless you reapply the element.
  </p>
  <p>So a dendro applicator almost does not need to apply dendro as often as a 'dendro xingqiu' (or dendro yelan).
    Even if you apply dendro once in a while, that will be sufficient to support an electro aggravate dps like Cyno
    because the dendro and quicken status will stick,
    whereas for vaporize the hydro status needs to be constantly replenished as it will be consumed by pyro.
    And that is why the DMC works with Cyno.
    Even if the DMC's Q is 15s, the quicken status will last beyond that because it is sticky,
    thereby allowing Cyno to proc aggravate throughout his 18s burst.
    So Cyno's long field time works with quicken.
  </p><p>
    Applying dendro on every hit (without icd) is nice especially
    if you are a spread dendro dps and want to spread on every hit.
    If you can apply dendro on every hit, then it will be easier to spread on every hit
    because unlike vape, the quicken status lasts much longer and does not need to be replenished as often.
    That is you can apply electro and say spread three times without icd without having to reapply electro.
    But if you apply hydro you may only be able to vaporize once before having to reapply hydro.
    This is the difference between vaporize and quicken.
    Although vaporize is multiplicative and quicken is additive,
    quicken is more sticky and robust, decreasing the need for frequent re-application.
  </p>
  <p>
    Suppose that quicken can increase electro or dendro damage by 2 times from the additive buff.
    That does not mean the total damage will be doubled.
    This is because of icd.
    Not every hit will proc spread or aggravate.
    Usually every 3 hits will proc a reaction (or every 2.5s).
    So on average the overall damage increase from quicken is (2+1+1)/3 = 4/3 or 1.33 times.
    That is if we use dendro/electro on a quickened target three times within a short time period, 
    only one of those hits will be doubled.
    This is why the goal of many quicken dps units is to attack many times within a short time period.
    They make a tradeoff between scaling and frequency (less scaling for more hits/higher frequency), 
    just so they can proc the quicken additive buff as many times as possible.
    That is why these quicken dps units usually can do many hits with less scaling in a short time interval.
  </p>


  <h3>Effect of dendro: the big winners are electro and hydro</h3>
  <p>The introduction of the 7th element dendro, with characters such as Nahida, Alhaitham, Yaoyao, 
    have brought a change in the balance of elements.
    Before 3.0, anemo was the dominant element, geo only had Itto, electro had Raiden and Yae,
    pyro was a good element too, cryo was decent, hydro was decent.
    But after 3.0, dendro balanced the element meta, buffing certain elements.
    First, dendro buffed electro characters via the quicken reaction.
    Second, dendro buffed hydro via the bloom/burgeon/hyperbloom reaction.
    Dendro did not bring as much change to pyro besides burgeon (as burning already existed in the game),
    and dendro did not do much for anemo, geo, or cryo (due to lack of interaction).
    So the biggest winners of dendro are electro and hydro characters.
  </p><p>
    Now Raiden was a character that was excellent without dendro.
    So dendro basically took a goddess to even higher above the clouds.
    Although Cyno and Raiden are both burst electro dps,
    Cyno kind of needs dendro (specifically Nahida) to reach his apex,
    whereas Raiden does not.
  </p>

  <h2>The best element?</h2>
  <p>A commonly asked question is what element is the 'best'?
    Is it even true that certain elements are better than others?
    A general answer is that it depends on the situation.
    Each element has its own advantages in different scenarios.
  </p>
  <p>
    Elements can be grouped in two clusters.
    There are now three elements that interact with every other element in the game: pyro, hydro, electro.
    And then there are the other four elements: anemo, geo, dendro, cryo.
    Pyro has melt, vape, burgeon, overload, burning.
    Hydro has vape, freeze, bloom, EC.
    Electro has quicken, hyperbloom, superconduct, overload, EC.
    All have swirl and crystallize.
  </p><p>
    Because of vv, anemo will always be meta.
    The fact that many anemo characters have crowd control and exploration benefits (like Venti, Scaramouche, Xiao)
    solidifies anemo's status as the premiere element of the game,
    even after the introduction of dendro.
  </p><p>
    Geo really only has Itto.
    Shields are not really needed as oftentimes a team wants more offense than defense.
    Zhongli's res shred is easily replaceable in all situations (vv, Faruzan, superconduct, deepwood).
  </p><p>
    Nahida and Alhaitham make dendro op and compensate for mid characters like Tighnari and Baizhu.
    Moreover, dendro resonance gives an EM buff, which buffs reactions and is useful for many teams.
  </p><p>
    For electro, many teams can take advantage of quicken and hyperbloom.
    Superconduct really only benefits Eula.
    Overload does a lot of damage like hyperbloom and burgeon, but knocks enemies around.
    However, vapeload does benefit many teams like Rational.
    Similarly, EC alone is ok, but becomes better with vapeload.
    So electro's reactions are overall great.
    Moreover electro resonance generates more energy particles.
  </p><p>
    For cryo, again superconduct only benefits Eula.
    Freeze can be used on various teams, but its drawback is that not every enemy can be frozen,
    especially big bosses (whereas you can use say hyperbloom on many big booses).
    Other than that, melt is probably cryo's most powerful reaction,
    and Dehya allows many cryo dps to melt readily.
    Cryo's other saving grace is that cryo resonance gives 15% cr (on opponents affected by cryo),
    and blizzard gives another 20% cr (on opponents affected by cryo).
    However, the additional 20% cr (on frozen opponents) is not always achievable as not every enemy can be frozen.
    So in terms of reactions, cryo is a bit weaker than elements, 
    but at least has access to melt and crit rate buff.
  </p><p>
    For hydro, many teams can use bloom (and hyperbloom/burgeon).
    Hydro also has access to vape, a powerful reaction, and freeze.
    Hydro can also enable EC, which becomes better with vapeload.
    Overall, like electro, hydro has access to very good reactions.
    Hydro resonance used to be mid (giving healing bonus),
    but after 3.0, it gave 25% hp, which is much better, especially since more units scale with hp.
    Still, electro and cryo resonance provides a bit stronger buff 
    (as not every unit needs hp, whereas more units want energy and crit).
  </p><p>
    Lastly, pyro has access to two multiplicative reactions, vape and melt.
    This alone makes pyro one of the most powerful elements.
    Moreover, pyro resonance gives 25% atk.
    Also, Bennett, one of the best universal characters in the game is pyro.
    For exploration, pyro is needed a lot for lighting torches and burning vines.
    Other than that, pyro has burgeon (a good reaction),
    overload (which becomes better with vapeload),
    and burning (which is only really used for melt teams).
  </p><p>
    Rather than give an explicit ranking of the elements,
    here we will say which elements have room for improvement and rebalancing.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Anemo: the best element for eons to come, even before the swirl buff, even after dendro.
      The anemo characters are extremely versatile, useable in most teams in the game with vv,
      and provide CC and exploration benefits.
      The only thing that may need rebalancing (a buff) is anemo resonance (which gives atk spd and cd reduction).
    </li>
    <li>Pyro, Electro, Hydro, Dendro (tie): very balanced elements with access to many reactions.
      Most of their reactions are good and useful for many teams.
      Each provides a useful resonance applicable to many teams.
      It is hard to make them any better without breaking the balance of elements or making one too OP.
      The only thing really missing is an hp Bennett, a hydro Dehya/Nahida, and a vaporize-based hydro dps
      (that does not need Candace; most hydro dps are enablers/apply hydro too quickly).
    </li>
    <li>Cryo: melt is good, freeze is situational, superconduct is only for Eula. Cryo resonance is good.
      What would make this element better is a cryo Yelan/XQ or cryo Dehya/Nahida (currently nonexistent as of 3.5).
    </li>
    <li>Geo: unless the game releases more geo characters, Itto is probably the only saving grace of this element.
      But perhaps that is the nature of this element, to be as defensive as a solid rock or shield,
      whereas the rest of the elements provide more offensive utility.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Before dendro, the electro and hydro elements probably were not as op as pyro, reaction-wise.
    Electro only had vapeload, but was not even necessary for reaction teams.
    But after dendro, giving access to quicken and bloom, the electro and hydro elements are now more balanced,
    though electro gained much more from dendro (whereas hydro at least had vape and freeze).
  </p>


  <h2>ICD</h2>
  <p>There is a limit to how often an element can be applied.
    For most abilities in the game, the standard ICD is 2.5s or 3 hits.
    That is an element can be applied once every 2.5 seconds or every 3 hits of that element.
  </p><p>
    There are only a handful of abilities that may not have an ICD (or the ICD is short enough).
    These include things like Diluc's E, Xiao's plunging, most polearm charged attacks.
    In practice this means that Diluc can vaporize each E hit.
    Some characters may have ICDs that differ from 2.5s or 3 hits.
    In practice and for calculations, the ICD tends to matter for characters that rely on vaporize, melt, or quicken to deal damage.
