  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>In Teyvat there are seven elements, with each element corresponding to one of the seven nations.
    For version 1-2, there have been 6 main elements.
    It is anticipated that when Sumeru releases, Dendro will also be introduced as the seventh element.
  </p>

  <h2>Dendro</h2>
  <p>Dendro already has a reaction: burning. This happens when pyro makes contact with a dendro object,
  like wooden shields, grass, hay, dendro slimes, etc.
  It takes a certain amount of pyro gauge units (strong 2B) to get grass burning.
  It can be thought of as a certain 'dendro shield'.
  One the shield is broken, the grass will start burning.
  </p><p>
    A recent trailer announced that there will be two new reactions for dendro:
    bloom and catalyze.
    Bloom happens when dendro+hydro react.
    Catalyze happens when dendro+electro react.
  </p><p>
    Bloom appears to drop a green plant, similar to how crystallize drops an elemental shard.
  </p><p>
    Catalyze appears to apply some sort of effect to the enemy.
    The game devs said it combines the 'wisdom' aspect related to dendro (as Sumeru is the nation of wisdom)
    and the energy aspect of Electro.
    They say it is connected to the local history of Sumeru.
