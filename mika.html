  <p>Mika has the epithet 晴霜的标绘 qingshuang de biaohui.
    Given his va, this could refer to how Deng Xiaoping executed Zhu Guohua, the grandson of Zhu De.
    The fact that Mika is a physical buffer that can support Eula 
    gives further credence on this line of interpretation.
  </p><p>
    The only thing that does not make sense is why Mika was released on Ayaka's banner in 3.5.
    Mika does not synergize much with Ayaka.

  <h2>Teams</h2>
  <p>Mika can support any physical dps, including: Eula, Rosaria, Razor.</p>
