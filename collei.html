  <p>
    Collei is better than tighnari.
  </p><p>
    Collei features in the manga.
    In her past Dottore performed some experiments on her.
    During that time, she did not show any symptoms of her disease.
    However, she was traumatized by Dottore.
    She also traveled to Mondstadt and became friends with Amber.
    They wrote letters to each other, and Collei learned about the golden haired traveler.
  </p>
  <p>Trivia: both Collei and Kuki have green hair and purple eyes.
    Maybe this is to suggest putting dendro and electro together (for the catalyze reaction).
  </p>

  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>Her E throws a boomerang. 
    Her Q summons Cuilen-Anbor, a symbol of her friendship with Amber and the Baron Bunny.
    It does AoE dendro dmg dot.
    Radius is 6m, similar to Bennett's Q.
