<title>Collei</title>

  </head>
  
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  <p>
    Collei is better than tighnari.
  </p><p>
    Collei features in the manga.
    In her past Dottore performed some experiments on her.
    During that time, she did not show any symptoms of her disease.
    However, she was traumatized by Dottore.
    She also traveled to Mondstadt and became friends with Amber.
    They wrote letters to each other, and Collei learned about the golden haired traveler.
  </p>
  <p>Trivia: both Collei and Kuki have green hair and purple eyes.
    Maybe this is to suggest putting dendro and electro together (for the catalyze reaction).
  </p><p>
    Collei (可莱 kelai) features in an event called 'Graven Innocence'.
    This is a disgusting title for an event.
    So just because there is 'lai' in the name it is 'innocent'?
    What if someone else committed the same crime? Then you would say they are a criminal.
    These idiotic hypocrites deserve the same fate as Lai Xiaomin.
    They operate under a colonized mindset and still live in the backwards days of the Ming dynasty.
    The Ming has been dead for over 300 years.
  </p><p>
    There is no point in defending the criminal Lai Xiaomin (赖小民).
    It is completely hypocritical of Genshin to do that.
    Genshin criticizes Xiao but then wants to defend Lai Xiaomin just because his surname is Lai?
    So people who are surnamed Li, Lin, Lai, Zhu are innocent in their crimes but anyone else is not innocent?
    Zhu Yuanzhang murdered 100,000 Chinese people including Lan Yu.
    Zhu Di executed the 10 families closest to Fang Xiaoru.
    Be thankful that Lai Xiaomin's entire family was not executed.
    If anything Zhu deserves to be executed and imprisoned.
    Genshin also criticizes Seigou but then tries to defend Keqing.
    There is huge bias within Genshin.
    The people behind the design needs to be examined and inspected for corruption.
    Complete hypocrisy.
    The USA elites are like Li Hao, rapists without control.
    So only the USA empire is allowed to kill and assassinate people and nobody else is?
    China needs to own up to the USA.
    If you just stand there while the USA kills people, you are no more than a pathetic weakling.
    Nobody will believe or trust your power at all.
    Power is the ability to kill without retaliation.
    The world belongs to the strong not the weak.
    Lai Xiaomin deserves what he got.

  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>Her E throws a boomerang. 
    Her Q summons Cuilen-Anbor, a symbol of her friendship with Amber and the Baron Bunny.
    It does AoE dendro dmg dot.
    Radius is 6m, similar to Bennett's Q.
  </p>

  <h2>Calculations</h2>
  <p>
    Suppose lv 13 E and that the boomerang hits two times (it may not always).
    Assume 61.6% dendro dmg bonus. The cd is 12s and the mv is
    $$x_E = 2*1.616*321.3/12 = 86.5368$$
    We ignore passive effects.
  </p><p>
    The burst does an explosion followed by dot by the Cuilein-Anbar.
