<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Talents">Talents</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Elemental_Skill">Elemental Skill</span></h3>
<p>Albedo is basically used for his Elemental Skill, which creates a 10m radius circle that does Transient Bloom Geo damage within the AoE against opponents that are hit.
</p><p>The Transient Bloom damage scales with Albedo's DEF.
</p><p>It also creates a Solar Isotoma "elevator" that one can stand on to gain height to do (high) plunging attacks. The max vertical height the elevator reaches is around the height of Zhongli's stele.
</p><p>The skill has a 30 second duration and 4 second cooldown, so similar to Raiden's skill, it can basically last forever, and Albedo hardly needs to be on the field. So he can spend more time doing alchemy research.
</p><p>The skill also generates Geo particles, so Albedo can be used as a "Geo battery".
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Elemental_Burst">Elemental Burst</span></h3>
<p>With one of Albedo's passives, using his burst will grant 125 EM to nearby party members for 10s. This can be useful for reaction teams (vaporize, melt).
</p><p>It costs 40 energy, so Albedo usually does not need much ER.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Constellations">Constellations</span></h2>
<p>His constellations are overall ok. His C4 increases plunging attack DMG by 30% for those within the Solar Isotoma field, which is ok for Xiao.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Build">Build</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Artifacts">Artifacts</span></h3>
<p>Since Version 2.3, the Husk of Opulent Pines is Albedo's BiS.
</p><p>Before Version 2.3, Albedo could be run on 2 piece Archaic Petra and 2 piece Noblesse.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Artifact_Stats">Artifact Stats</span></h3>
<p>A typical Albedo build is to go for DEF on the sands, Geo DMG Bonus on the goblet, and CRIT (or DEF) on the circlet. Substats include CRIT, DEF, and sometimes ATK if one is building more into burst damage.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Weapons">Weapons</span></h3>
<p>The Version 2.3 event sword Cinnabar Spindle (which one can get to R5) is Albedo's BiS.
</p><p>Albedo has a solid 3 star option that is usually better than many 4 star options:
</p>
<ul><li>Harbinger of Dawn R5: However, the Cinnabar sword is usually more consistent against the new Corrosion effect (which will lower Albedo's HP even if he is not on field).</li></ul>
<p>Among 4 stars:
</p>
<ul><li>Cinnabar Spindle: with this one can go for a CRIT circlet over a DEF circlet, especially when the Husk set gives DEF as well</li>
<li>Festering Desire is solid</li></ul>
<p>The 5 star options are mostly good. Note that as Albedo's skill damage scales with DEF, he may not need too much ATK:
</p>
<ul><li>Jade Cutter: providing CRIT Rate but low base ATK is a very suitable option for Albedo</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Teams">Teams</span></h2>
<p>Albedo is usually run for Geo resonance with Zhongli. This pair is then stuck on to other teams that center around a hypercarry.
</p><p>Albedo has been used in the following top-tier ("meta") teams (also popular in Spiral Abyss):
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Xiao-Jean-Albedo-Zhongli (although this does not deal as much damage as Xiao-Bennett teams)</li>
<li>Hu Tao-Xingqiu-Albedo-Zhongli (although this may not deal as much damage as Hu Tao-Xingqiu-Thoma-Kazuha)</li>
<li>Diluc-Xingqiu-Albedo-Zhongli (with Diluc in place of Hu Tao; though a Diluc-Xingqiu-Bennett-Venti team can usually do more damage)</li>
  <li>Itto-Gorou-Albedo-Bennett (this is one of the teams where Albedo is one of the best picks)</li>
    </ol>
<p>A Ganyu melt team (Ganyu-Xiangling) often needs Bennett to battery Xiangling, and the fourth spot is usually contested with Kazuha, Zhongli, or Venti, so Ganyu does not need Albedo here.
</p><p>Another question is whether one can use Ningguang (with Thrilling Tales) in place of Albedo for the above teams. Usually, Albedo provides more off-field utility than Ningguang, so it is better to run Albedo.
</p><p>Albedo is overall a solid support that is typically used for more defensive, comfortable gameplay and Geo resonance. That said, there are usually more offensive teams that can deal higher DPS.
</p>

<h2>Calculations</h2>
<p>
  At Lv10 his E does 240.48% DEF at most once every 2 seconds. The mv is then
  $$z = 240.48/2 = 120.24\% \text{ DEF}$$  
  Suppose Albedo has 4 piece Husk with a Geo DMG goblet and is Lv90.
  His total damage bonus with max stacks is
  $$46.6 + 24 + 28.8 = 99.4$$
  So the dps is
  $$x = 1.994z = 239.75856\% \text{ DEF}$$
  If one has Geo Resonance (giving 15% more DMG bonus) the dps is
  $$x_g = 2.144z = 257.79456\% \text{ DEF}$$
</p>
<p>
  Note that the dmg bonus from geo resonance will not work off-field.
  As Albedo is usually played off field, he will not receive the 15% dmg bonus then.
  He will only get it if he is on field and shielded.
  However, the -20% geo res shred will still apply to Albedo's damage, even if off-field.
</p><p>
  Often Albedo is played in Itto-Gorou teams, 
  but since Gorou's buffs apply to on-field characters ('active' characters),
  Albedo will not receive Gorou's buffs either.
</p>
<p>
  Suppose Albedo has 3000 DEF, whereas a typical dps character may have 2000 ATK.
  With Bennett, characters can reach 3000 ATK.
  So the DEF to ATK conversion is roughly 1 to 1.
  It is possible to boost Albedo's DEF with Gorou,
  but Gorou is more of a niche character compared to Bennett.
  Note since the damage scales with DEF, it is unaffected by ATK boosts such as Bennett's buff.
  </p>
  </p>
  The scaling is ok, but the advantage really is the 100% uptime.
  It is literally free damage.
<p>

  <h2>Weapon</h2>
  <p>The 2.3 cinnabar weapon gives 69% def and increases Albedo's E dmg by x% of his DEF.
    Since Albedo's E scales with his DEF, this weapon effectively increases his E scaling.
    Cinnabar is sometimes compared with the pjc and harbinger of dawn.
  </p><p>
    The r5 cinnabar gives 80% more scaling to Albedo's E (increasing the dps by 33%).
    The mv becomes
    $$z = (240.48 + 80)/2 = 160.24\% \text{ DEF}$$
    The dps is then
    $$x = 319.51856$$
    With geo resonance it is
    $$x_g = 343.55456$$
    This makes Albedo do more damage than ayaka.
