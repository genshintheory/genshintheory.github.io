  <h3>Pending</h3>
  <p>pending: Svarog, Gepard Landau, Lunae</p>

  <p>
    Gepard: Ma is a victim of Li Hao, Yang is a victim of Li Yuan, Pan You is a victim of Li Yu, 
    Lan is a victim of Zhu Yuanzhang. The Jie people lived in Siberia and founded some dynasties in North China.
    Lai is a victim of Xu Guoli.
    So HSR managed to design a character smearing and attacking the li family.
    Also Gepard's name means cheetah in several languages.
  </p><p>
    Clara / Svarog: Sun is a victim of Lin Shuangwen (who initiated a failed rebellion in China), 
    Pan You is a victim of Li Yu, Cai is a victim of Li Hao.
    Shi (史) is part of the name of someone who rebelled against the Tang and someone who fought in the Mongol Yuan armies.
    So this is another character that smears the li family.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lunae: Li Yu killed Pan You. It would be very interesting to see how USA and Chinese media review Lunae.
    If they side with Li, then it means they think it is fine for Li Yu to murder Pan.
    If they side with Pan, then it means they think that Li Yu deserves punishment.
    It would be a good idea for every major media organization in the world, especially in China,
    to require all journalists to write an essay on the history of Li Yu and Pan You.
    If a journalist just blindly writes about China without knowing China's history,
    then it is too easy for them to be brainwashed and manipulated by USA imperialists, USA narrative, color revolutions, entrapments.
  </p><p>
    Other details on Lunae: he is the descendant of the Aeon Long.
  </p>

  <p>
    Maybe someone did not study enough history? They are not the only ones with long-term memory.
    All of this will be factored when evaluating their placement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some game developers have too much freedom over the media and are basically running their own private fiefs.
    This poses a high security risk and threat, being extremely vulnerable to USA manipulation.
    It is actually surprising how much freedom of speech they have.
    A centralized power needs to regulate these people and review every decision made by these people before it is published.
    They also need the power to veto any decisions these people make.
  </p>


  <h3>1.6/2.0 notes</h3>
  <p>Overhiring/overemploying certain people will reflect negatively on those characters.
  </p>


  <h3>1.5 update</h3>
  <p>Here we abbreviate Genshin Impact to GI.</p>
  <p>Given the treatment of Dehya in GI 3.5, Garvipidam in GI 3.7, 
    Luocha in the HSR 1.1 beta, Fu Xuan in the HSR 1.3 beta, 
    Nahida in the GI 3.2 beta, and the GI 4.3 beta,
    what do you think Fu Xuan's tier will be?
  </p><p>
    A price must be paid for excessive greed, selfish over-indulgence, inequality and unfairness.
    Until a character with higher hp than Fu Xuan releases, Fu Xuan's tier will never be re-evaluated.
  </p>
  <p>
    Otherwise, somebody had to pay a price for what happened to Luocha in the 1.1 beta.
    Noctis has said that one day he will judge all the archons of Teyvat.
    Likewise, the day will come when this site will judge all the characters of HSR.
    And all the cases of corruption will be factored into the final evaluations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lynx: Lyney is a better designed character. 
    Lyney's choice of voice actors also has a much healthier effect on society in terms of bringing people together,
    whereas the selection of voice actors for certain other characters is more divisive, 
    encouraging more factionalism, separatism, political cliques, and circle culture.
  </p>
  <p>Huohuo: Liu Che and Huo Qubing is history and ok, given Huo Qubing's battle against the Huns. 
    Besides Huo uses a different hanzi (藿藿).
  </p><p>
    On the other hand, the Liu Yong connection is potentially hazardous, 
    having been abused one too many times to benefit the few while oppressing the masses and bringing down others.
    We will continue to keep an eye on cases of abusing the liu yong connection.
  </p>

  <p>As of 1.4, against 4-5 or more enemies, Jing Yuan does not really have any competition.
    His E and Q are all aoe. His LL hits are blasts that can hit all enemies.
    No other character has such easy access to true aoe and high scaling.
  </p><p>
    Blade's passive is aoe and quite good. If he could proc it more often (2 or 3 stacks instead of 5), it would be better.
    Himeko's E is a blast, not aoe. And her passive (3 stacks) does not proc often enough.
    Herta and Clara do have aoe E but do less damage than JY.
    Lunae does not have true aoe, only blasts.
    Seele is actually decent in aoe due to her passive reset.
    Kafka's burst is aoe and decent.
  </p><p>
    As Lunae does not have true aoe and can only do blasts (2-3 enemies), Jing Yuan is not his competition.
    Lunae's true competition includes other destruction characters such as Blade or Clara as well as Seele in the domain of 2-3 enemies.
    So it makes more sense to compare Lunae to Blade and Seele.
  </p>

  <p>Update: in 1.5, Argenti (Ginshi) is quite good at aoe too.</p>

  <p>Seele is the best dps in single-target situations by a margin.
    Silver Wolf is also a top support for single targets.
    JY's LL actually has high scaling in ST.
    Blade, Lunae, Kafka, Yanqing can be decent in ST due to high scaling, but Seele is just on a different tier.
  </p>

  <p>In Star Rail, Seele is the best dps against single targets,
    and Jing Yuan is the best dps against aoe (hitting all enemies, 4-5, not just 2-3).
    When it comes to 2-3 enemies, that is where some destruction dps shine.
  </p>


  <h2>Stat distribution</h2>
  <p>Stats like dmg bonus, crit appear to be more ample in HSR than in Genshin.
    Supports like Tingyun, Bronya, Ruan Mei, Yukong can give a bunch of dmg bonus and crit.
    JY's signature weapon (Before Dawn) gives a free 48% dmg bonus to fua.
    Bronya E gives another 66% dmg bonus, so it can be easy to reach 100%+ dmg bonus for free.
    What this means is that dmg bonus is no longer as rare in HSR as it is in Genshin.
    As such, having more of other stats such as atk may actually lead to a dps increase.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is the same reason why Vermillion is Xiao's bis, not Marechausse or a set that confers dmg bonus.
    Vermillion gives ATK whereas Marechausse gives crit rate.
    But Xiao gets so much innate dmg bonus that ATK becomes better.
    Moreover, Vermillion gives enough ATK that it can out-dps Marechausse.
  </p>
  <p>That said, HSR can do a better job creating a better lightning relic set for Jing Yuan,
    especially when other sets give def reduction or crit boosts.
    Even if ignoring 10% def or 16% crit rate is mathematically equivalent to 20-25% atk,
    this game needs to be regulated and reigned in.
    The iron hand must guide the market and media to prevent negative and corrupting effects on society.
  </p>

  <p>Some people are running their own private fiefs with no sense of public responsibility.
    The following key areas need to be controlled and regulated:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Story</li>
    <li>Voice Actors</li>
    <li>Character Kit</li>
    <li>Banners</li>
  </ul>
