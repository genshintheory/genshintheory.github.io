  <h3>Pending</h3>
  <p>pending: Svarog, Gepard Landau</p>

  <p>
    Gepard: Ma is a victim of Li Hao, Yang is a victim of Li Yuan, Pan You is a victim of Li Yu, 
    Lan is a victim of Zhu Yuanzhang. The Jie people lived in Siberia and founded some dynasties in North China.
    Lai is a victim of Xu Guoli.
    So HSR managed to design a character smearing and attacking the li family.
    Also Gepard's name means cheetah in several languages.
  </p><p>
    Clara / Svarog: Sun is a victim of Lin Shuangwen (who initiated a failed rebellion in China), 
    Pan You is a victim of Li Yu, Cai is a victim of Li Hao.
    Shi (Âè≤) is part of the name of someone who rebelled against the Tang and someone who fought in the Mongol Yuan armies.
    So this is another character that smears the li family.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lunae: Li Yu murdered Pan You. It would be very interesting to see how USA and Chinese media review Lunae.
    If they side with Li, then it means they think it is fine for Li Yu to murder Pan.
    If they side with Pan, then it means they think that Li Yu deserves punishment.
    It would be a good idea for every major media organization in the world, especially in China,
    to require all journalists to write an essay on the history of Li Yu and Pan You.
    If a journalist just blindly writes about China without knowing China's history,
    then it is too easy for them to be brainwashed and manipulated by USA imperialists, USA narrative, color revolutions, entrapments.
  </p><p>
    Other details on Lunae: he is the descendant of the Aeon Long.
  </p>

  <p>
    Maybe someone did not study enough history? They are not the only ones with long-term memory.
    All of this will be factored when evaluating their placement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some game developers have too much freedom over the media and are basically running their own private fiefs.
    This poses a high security risk and threat, being extremely vulnerable to USA manipulation.
    It is actually surprising how much freedom of speech they have.
    A centralized power needs to regulate these people and review every decision made by these people before it is published.
    They also need the power to veto any decisions these people make.

  <p>Currently, against 4-5 or more enemies, Jing Yuan does not really have any competition.
    His E and Q are all aoe. His LL hits are blasts that can hit all enemies.
    No other character has such easy access to true aoe and high scaling.
  </p><p>
    Blade's passive is aoe and quite good. If he could proc it more often (2 or 3 stacks instead of 5), it would be better.
    Himeko's E is a blast, not aoe. And her passive (3 stacks) does not proc often enough.
    Herta and Clara do have aoe E but do less damage than JY.
    Lunae does not have true aoe, only blasts.
    Seele is actually decent in aoe due to her passive reset.
