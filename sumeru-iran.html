  <h1>Thus spoke Zarathustra</h1>
  
  <p>Sorush refers to the traveler as her Yasnapati (ê¨´ê¨Äê¨Øê¨•ê¨Ä ê¨ûê¨Äê¨åê¨ôê¨å).
    This is an Avestan term meaning lord of ritual or sacrifice.
    It is translated as Ë∞íÈ¢Ç‰∏ª in Chinese.
  </p>

  <p>
    Avestan is Old Persian (used from 1500-500 bce) up to the time of Cyrus' Persian Empire.
    The Avestan script is descended from Phoenician and Akkadian.
    It was created during Persia's Sasanian era (around 200-600 ce, before Arabic came).
    By the time of the Sasanian empire, Avestan was already an extinct language,
    but its liturgies were memorized by rote and passed down the generations by priests.
  </p><p>
    Avestan was the language of Zoroastrianism, one of the oldest religions in the world.
    Many of the things in Sumeru are references to Zoroastrianism.
    This gives further evidence that the concept of Sumeru goes back much further back in time before the advent of Islam.
    It goes back to even Scythian, Aryan, and Elamite times.
    The concept of Sumeru incorporates not just Islam, but the vast history of the Mesopotamia region before the rise of Islam,
    from Sumer (~4500-1900 bc), Akkadian (~2300-2100 bc), Babylonia (~1900-500 bc).
  </p>


  <h2>The Aryans / Airya / Alans as the founders of Iranian civilization</h2>
  <p>
    Ancient Egypt and Sumer existed for thousands of years before 2000 bc,
    when the Aryan nomads started to invade from the steppe.
    The Aryans are associated with the Sintashta culture in Chelyabinsk Oblast (Russia).
    They are thought to be the ancestors of various people from Europe to India,
    as well as the original speakers of many European and Indian languages.
    The Aryans were referred to as Airya in Old Iranian.
  </p><p>
    The Indo-Aryans started settling in northern India around 2000-1000 bc.
    They spoke the Vedic Sanskrit language and are associated with Hindu literature such as the Vedas.
    Sanskrit was orally preserved until around the 3rd century bc, 
    when the first Brahmic writing inscriptions started appearing in India (such as the Edicts of Ashoka).
    Devanagari was invented nearly 1000 years later around the 7th century ce.
    In Vedic texts, the term Aryan was used to refer to those who worshipped the Vedic gods (such as Indra, Agni).
    The Vedic text Aranyaka recorded the geographic area where the Aryan languages were spoken.
    The Aryans appear to have a certain connection to the Aranara creatures of Sumeru.
    In fact, Aranyaka is the name of one of the Aranara quests.
  </p><p>
    Around 1800 bc, the proto-Iranian and proto-Indo-Aryan langauges are estimated to have split.
    Proto-Iranian would become Old Iranian (Avestan), which would become modern Persian (Farsi).
  </p><p>
    The Aryans also settled in Iran, and Deioces (Ëø™Â••Â°ûÊñØ) established the Median empire / Medes (a successor state of Assyria).
    Median was an Old Iranian language related to Bactrian and Sogdian (spoken in Central Asia at the time).
    The Greek geographer Strabo (who lived in Turkey) wrote that the Median empire 
    was part of the Ariana (Aryan) civilization, grouping Media and Persia together.
    For a time the Median empire was ruled by Scythians, but then they were expelled.
    The Scythians were another Iranian nomadic steppe people that started settling south from the 9th to 3rd centuries bc.
    There were several other Iranian nomadic tribes such as the Agathyrsi, Cimmerians, Sarmatians.
    After Scythian rule, Cyaxares ruled over the Median empire and allied with the Neo-Babylonian empire to destroy the Neo-Assyrian empire.
    This resulted in power consolidation in the middle east region and expansion of the Median state.
    Now there were only a few power players left, including Median Persia, Babylon, Ancient Egypt, etc.
    Eventually one would rise to unify them all: the Achaemenid empire.
  </p><p>
    Cyaxares was then succeeded by his son Astygas, and in 550 bc Astygas was overthrown by his grandson Cyrus the Great, 
    who founded the Achaemenid empire (also called the Persian empire).
    In some sense the Achaemenid empire could be thought of as a continuation of the Median empire and Persian culture.
    However, the difference is that the Median empire left no written records of their own.
    All the writing on Medes from that time period is from external sources such as the Greeks, Assyrians, Babylonians, Armenians.
    It was after Cyrus founded the Achaemenid empire that we find the earliest written records in Persian,
    such as the Behistun inscription from the time of Darius' rule (~500 bc) written in Persian cuneiform 
    (somewhat based on the Sumer-Akkadian cuneiform).
  </p><p>
    The Achaemenid king Darius and his son Xerxes referred to themselves as Airya/Ariya (Aryans).
    Over time, the Ar became Er as in Eran (Middle Persian) and then Ir as in Iran (modern Persian).
    In the Scythian language, Aryan manifested itself as the term Alan,
    as in the nomadic steppe Alan people, related to the Yancai (Â•ÑËî°) people of west China
    (the Alans/Yancai would eventually migrate and settle in Europe and India along with the descendants of the Xiongnu/Hunnic people).
    In Genshin, one sees the prefix Ara attached to the Aranara creatures' names.
    In Chinese, Ara is transcribed as ÂÖ∞ which is also used to write Alan (ÈòøÂÖ∞), referring to the Yancai people.
  </p><p>
    Just as in India, in ancient Iran the term Aryan originally had a religious connotation, 
    used to refer to those associated with the Zoroastrian faith.
    But over time, it evolved to encompass other things, referring to political, cultural, national, and ethnic entities.
    Moreover, the further back in history one goes, one finds that the Aryans, Alans, etc. have a close connection to China.
    So when the traveler crosses the border from Liyue to Sumeru, some of the first things they meet are the Ara creatures themselves.
    Perhaps it is not so surprising, given the Aryan's historical ties with ancient China.
  </p>

  <p>The Aryan languages were not the only ones spoken in ancient Iran.
    There used to be the Elamite language (considered a language isolate) 
    around the Persian Gulf region from 2600-330 bc.
    When Alexander entered Persia, the Elamite language eventually disappeared.
    Nowadays, Farsi is the predominant language of Iran.
    Perhaps one can thank Alex for that.
  </p>

  <p>Zoroastrianism is one of the oldest religions of the world, with oral roots dating back to ~2000 bc
    and its written history starting ~600 bc.
    Manichaeism (Êë©Â∞ºÊïô) is a newer religion founded by Mani (a Parthian) in Sassanid Persia in the 200s ce,
    near the end of the Han dynasty.
    Manichaeism eventually spread around the world from the Roman Empire to ancient China.
    To this day, Manichaeism is still practiced in parts of China such as Fujian and Zhejiang.
    In Iran, there was a time of some conflict between Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism,
    but eventually the term 'Aryan' changed to incorporate not just one particular religion,
    but a broader cultural entity of Iran as a whole.
  </p>

  <p>
    Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism, and Buddhism used to be much more prevalent in Iran, especially during the time of the Han dynasty.
    Since the arrival of the Arabs around the Tang dynasty, Islam has become the main religion of Iran to this day.
    But Zoroastrianism still survives: India is home to one of the largest Zoroastrian communities in the world,
    and the Avestan language has been written in the various Brahmic scripts of India (e.g. Gujarati, Devanagari).
    In this way, Zoroastrianism, something originally Iranian, has become a part of Indian culture.
    So the appearance of sundry cultures Persian, Indian, Egyptian, etc. in Sumeru is not just some random mix,
    but more of an organic and natural blend stemming from the tides of history in this geocultural region.
  </p><p>
    Throughout history, many Persians, Zoroastrians, etc. have migrated from Iran to modern Pakistan and India,
    whether via the empires of Cyrus, Alexander, Timur, Babur (Mughal), etc.
    The exchange of religion and ideas along this silk road represents a unifying theme tying this vast region together.
    In this sense, the concept of Sumeru as a cultural syncretism / amalgamation crystallizes into being.
