<p>We compute the DPS from a C6 Xiangling with a level 13 Q.
We assume Xiangling has a Pyro DMG goblet with Emblem of Severed Fate (for at least \(120(.25)+46.6=76.6%\) DMG Bonus on the Pyronado, which can obviously increase with greater ER).
Pyronado has no ICD, so assuming she can vaporize each hit, the damage scaling per hit is:
</p><dl><dd>\(z_{XL} = 1.766*1.5*238 = 630.462\)</dd></dl>
<p>We assume with C4 (the Pyronado lasts 14 seconds), the Pyronado can hit the enemy around 10 times.
The Pyronado has a 20 second cooldown. Assuming we can spam it on cooldown, the DPS is:
</p><dl><dd>x = 10z_{XL}/20 \approx 315.231</dd></dl>
