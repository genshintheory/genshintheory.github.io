  <p>Genshin Gastronomy: cuisine can tell a lot about a region's culture and influences.
    Genshin's food system is much more elaborate than Breath of Wild's.
    So this is one area where Genshin outshines Breath of Wild.
  </p>

  <p>Star Rail has food that can restore energy. It would be convenient to add such food to Genshin.
  </p><p>
    Star Rail also has food that increases max HP. Genshin would also benefit from this.
    In general, HSR appears to have way more effects that can increase / modify max HP than Genshin.
    If stats like atk have many ways to be buffed, why not HP?
    Basically in Genshin (as of v3), there are only a few things modifying HP such as Yelan's c4 or the withering effect.

  <p>The Mughal emperors Babur and Jahangir wrote a lot about mangoes, a fruit native to South Asia.</p>
