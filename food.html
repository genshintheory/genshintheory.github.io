<title>Food</title>

  <p>Genshin Gastronomy: cuisine can tell a lot about a region's culture and influences.
    Genshin's food system is much more elaborate than Breath of Wild's.
    So this is one area where Genshin outshines Breath of Wild.
  </p>
  <p>Speaking of which, food is not often used in combat (abyss, etc.),
    mostly serving cosmetic, artistic, and cultural purposes.
    If Genshin could design a combat event where you can say select 3 different dishes (with X, Y, Z conditions) 
    before challenging a stage, that could make food and cooking a bit more useful.
    Because right now, the whole food/cooking part of Genshin is mostly dormant, sitting inactivated (it just exists but not much else).
    But it is not like Genshin devs actually listen to fans... do they?
    </p>

  <h2>Learning from Star Rail</h2>
  <p>Star Rail has food that can restore energy. It would be convenient to add such food to Genshin.
  </p><p>
    Star Rail also has food that increases max HP. Genshin would also benefit from this.
    In general, HSR appears to have way more effects that can increase / modify max HP than Genshin.
    If stats like atk have many ways to be buffed, why not HP?
    Basically in Genshin (as of v3), there are only a few things modifying HP such as Yelan's c4 or the withering effect.
  </p>
  <p>In HSR there is also trash, which decreases a character's hp.
    Why would you ever eat trash?
    Perhaps some characters that want less hp to do more damage might benefit from this,
    so Arlan, Kuki, homa-users, hu tao (reverse destruction).
    But most 'normal' destruction characters are indifferent to this (some may even do less damage the less hp they have),
    such as Xiao, Focalors, Lyney, Noctis, Wrio.
    The 'normal' destruction characters synergize with healing, food, and Bennett (for atk scalers).
    The 'reverse' destruction characters have anti-synergy with food and healing.
  </p>


  <h2>Culture</h2>
  <p>The Mughal emperors Babur and Jahangir wrote a lot about mangoes, a fruit native to South Asia.</p>
