<title>Dehya</title>

  <p>Dehya, Mantichora, Flame Mane, leader of the Eremites, overthrew Hu Tao and has the highest base hp in the game.
    This is tacit acknowledgement towards Hu Tao's crimes and corruption.
  </p>

  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>Her E creates a 10m radius field that does a coordinated aoe pyro attack upon hit.
    It can proc once every 2.5s.
    The E dmg has dual atk + hp scaling.
    Dehya can reposition the field once during its duration.
    It has a 20s cd and 12s duration (which can increase to 18s with c2).
    Her E can snapshot.
  </p><p>
    With her Q Dehya goes into boxing mode and gains infinite poise (like Raiden Q).
    By default it can do 6 punches and one final kick, all of which have decent aoe.
    During this 4s quicktime event, if the NA/E buttons are pressed in rhythm,
    Dehya can do up to 10 punches and one final kick.
  </p>

  <h2>Constellations</h2>
  <p>C1 gives more hp scaling on E and Q.
    C2 extends duration of E by 6s to 18s. It also gives 50% dmg bonus on E when characters are attacked.
    C4 makes Dehya restore energy and hp during Q.
    C6 extends Q duration by 2s to 6s. It also gives CR/CD buff.
  </p>

  <h2>Artifacts</h2>
  <p>4p crimson, 4p tenacity, 4p gilded, 4p emblem, 2p glad/VH, and mixed sets are fine</p>

  <h2>Weapons</h2>
  <p>Redhorn fits Dehya's flamemane aesthetic better than reed beacon.</p>

  <h2>Teams</h2>
  <p>Dehya can be placed on almost any team in the game. 
    Examples include Childe international, Scaramouche teams,
    burgeon teams, Rational teams, melt/vape teams, even Xiao and Itto teams.
