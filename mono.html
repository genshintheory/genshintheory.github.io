  <p>Perhaps the opposite of reaction based teams such as hyperbloom are mono-element teams,
    usually consisting of only one to two elements.
    Mono teams have been the subject of many meme videos,
    featuring mono anemo and mono geo teams clearing abyss.
  </p><p>
    Mono teams are also the bane/antithesis of USA media, who like to sell the propaganda that you need reactions to do damage.
    But that's not necessarily true.
    You do not need to vape or spread every hit in order to deal high damage.
    Anemo, geo, physical units can deal high damage just by having higher scalings 
    rather than doing multiplicative/additive reactions.
  </p><p>
    Some classical examples of units that do not need amplifying reactions to do damage include:
    Xiao, Itto, Eula, Scaramouche.
    Technically, Eula has superconduct.
