<p>There is a fan theory circulating that Zandik (Dottore) is related to Rene of Fontaine.
  Part of this theory is that Dottore is an oceanid that can absorb the memories of other people
  similar to how primordial water can dissolve and collect the people's consciousness.
  As explained in Fontaine quests, when multiple people dissolve their memories and consciousness can be pooled together in a single entity such as an oceanid.
  Water can take on different forms and manifest in different shapes.
  So the 'segments' or 'clones' created by Dottore could be based on different people he dissolved and merged with using primordial water.
  This could also explain Dottore's blue design color and how he wears a vial of liquid by his ear.
  So would this make Dottore hydro?
</p><p>
  In this theory, either Dottore is Rene, Rene is a person dissolved/absorbed by Dottore, 
  or Rene is just another scientist who bears striking similarities to Dottore.
</p>
<p>Certain fans have pointed out that the research conducted by Rene and Dottore
  appears inspired by the real-life scientist Rene Descartes, who argued that the human body is like a machine
  and that the mind and body are separate entities.
  The mind can function without the body, but the body cannot function without the mind.
  Rene Descartes is also the namesake for the Cartesian coordinate system in mathematics as well as his signature phrase: 
  cogito ergo sum (I think therefore I am).
  Later philosophers such as Rene Guenon built upon this work when writing about metaphysics.
</p><p>
  In the Fontaine lore, Rene had a plan of dissolving all the people of Fontaine with primordial water to save them from the cataclysm
  and create one giant oceanid, one collective consciousness, almost similar to what the Akasha tried to do and the lore of the Golden Slumber.
