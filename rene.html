<h2>Rene and Dottore: Oceanid Theory</h2>
<p>There is a fan theory circulating that Zandik (Dottore) is related to Rene of Fontaine.
  Part of this theory is that Dottore is an oceanid that can absorb the memories of other people
  similar to how primordial water can dissolve and collect the people's consciousness.
</p><p>
  As explained in Fontaine quests, when multiple people dissolve their memories and consciousness can be pooled together in a single entity such as an oceanid.
  Water can take on different forms and manifest in different shapes.
  So the 'segments' or 'clones' created by Dottore could be based on different people he dissolved and merged with using primordial water.
  This could also explain Dottore's blue design color and how he wears a vial of liquid by his ear.
  So would this make Dottore hydro?
</p><p>
  So in this way, by being an oceanid, Dottore can live across multiple centuries
  and be one person while also being multiple individuals.
</p><p>
  In this theory, either Dottore is Rene, Rene is a person dissolved/absorbed by Dottore, 
  or Rene is just another scientist who bears striking similarities to Dottore.
</p>
<p>Certain fans have pointed out that the research conducted by Rene and Dottore
  appears inspired by the real-life scientist Rene Descartes, who argued that the human body is like a machine
  and that the mind and body are separate entities.
  The mind can function without the body, but the body cannot function without the mind.
  Rene Descartes is also the namesake for the Cartesian coordinate system in mathematics as well as his signature phrase: 
  cogito ergo sum (I think therefore I am).
  Later philosophers such as Rene Guenon built upon this work when writing about metaphysics.
</p><p>
  In the Fontaine lore, Rene had a plan of dissolving all the people of Fontaine with primordial water to save them from the cataclysm
  and create one giant oceanid, one collective consciousness, almost similar to what the Akasha tried to do and the lore of the Golden Slumber.
  However, Rene did not succeed with the plan.
</p>


<h2>Evangelion and Scaramouche</h2>
<p>As some fans have pointed out, Scaramouche's story bears striking similarities with that of Shinji in Neon Genesis Evangelion.
  Gendou treats Shinji a bit like how Dottore treats Scaramouche.
  Moreover, Scaramouche controls a robot powered by the soul of his 'mother' (Raiden).
  Gendou's goal was to melt the human race into a liquid (LCL), which is similar to Rene's goal.
  Evangelion is also known for Qabalah symbolism, which coincidentally also appears in Rene's world formula diagram.
</p><p>
  In the Evangelion series, Earth is seeded with two types of space creatures: humans and angels.
  The humans build robots to prevent the angels from destroying civilization.
  There had been a 1st and 2nd 'imapct' or cataclysm arising from such destruction.
  The goal is to prevent a 3rd impact.
  So this is reminiscent of Honkai Impact 3rd.
</p>


<h2>Oratrice</h2>
<p>Building on the above, some have speculated that the oratrice is a robotic liquid consciousness similar to an oceanid or Dottore.
</p>
<p>The only comments to be made is that much of this is still theory and not yet proven or disproven by the lore.
  We just have to wait and see as the story writers can always throw a curve ball.
  For example, there is another fan theory circulating that Elynas is similar to Durin and may be created by Gold.
  At this point, what can be said is that there is strong or explicit evidence that things like 
  Rene Descartes' philosophies, Evangelion, Qabalah, Gnosticism have inspired the lore in Genshin.
</p>


<h2>History and Literature</h2>
<p>
  Literature and literary references are certainly one common way of analyzing the lore and world of Genshin.
  History is another.
</p><p>
  As fans have pointed out, Scaramouche's story does indeed seem to be quite inspired by Evangelion's Shinji.
  That is one angle to analyze Scaramouche's character design.
  And this is a very safe way to analyze Scaramouche, something that is supported by literary references.
</p><p>
  History can provide a different angle to view Scaramouche's design and powers.
  As discussed, Scaramouche's overall design does seem to make a reference to Liu Che, the Han dynasty emperor.
  During Liu Che's reign, the Han dynasty expanded west and began interacting with many kingdoms in Central Asia,
  contacting Persian, Sogdian, Indian cultures on the Silk Road.
  So Scaramouche's presence in Sumeru almost reflects the Han dynasty presence in the western regions during Liu Che's reign.
  Liu Che was also known for defeating the Huns in the Eurasian steppe, which has symbolic connections to the 'nomadic' anemo element.
</p><p>
  The difference between the literature and historical analysis is that the historical interpretation may not be as explicitly stated.
  It is only something hinted at and may take a bit more comprehensive interpretation of the symbolism and history of the different Genshin regions and characters.
