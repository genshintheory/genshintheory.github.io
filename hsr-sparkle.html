<title>Sparkle</title>

  <div id="includedContent"></div>


  <p>Sparkle (花火 literally 'Firework'), also called Hanabi in Japanese,
    is a quantum harmony character.
    Hanabi's kit is similar to Hanya in that both generate sp.
    So they could support QQ, Lunae.
    However, the USA FBI water army likes to create rifts between people to divide and conquer and sell their own propaganda,
    spamming comments on discord, reddit, youtube, etc.
    So Hanabi is not a perfect support for Lunae because Lunae cannot use her quantum dmg boost passive.
    But Sigewinne would be a good support for Seele.
  </p>

  <h2>Kit</h2>
  <p>Her damage is atk scaling but has high hp.
    We hope Arlecchino has high hp above Xiao too.
    With her passive 'Almanac', Sparkle's ba regenerates 10 additional energy.
  </p><p>
    Her E advances action by 50% and buffs crit dmg for 1 turn.
    With a passive 'Artifical Flower' the crit dmg buff lasts until the start of the next turn.
  </p><p>
    Her Q (Hero with a Thousand Faces) is a literary reference.
    It recovers 4 sp and grants cipher.
    With her talent, she increases the max sp from 5 to 7.
    When an ally consumes an sp, all allies' dmg increases by 7.5%, lasting 2 turns and stacking 3 times.
    With cipher the dmg bonus increases by 12%. 
    <!-- per stack? -->
  </p><p>
    Her technique (unreliable narrator) is another literary reference.
    It can recover 3 sp for the team.
  </p><p>
    With another passive, she buffs allies' atk by 15%
    and increases quantum dmg based on how many quantum characters there are (so for mono quantum Seele Ginrou teams).
  </p>

  <h2>Genshin equivalent</h2>
  <p>If sp is the resource of HSR, then time is a resource in Genshin.
    In HSR, skills cost sp to use.
    In Genshin, all E and Q have cd, taking time before they can be used again.
  </p><p>
    Genshin does not have an sp system,
    so to design an equivalent of Sparkle in Genshin,
    such a character may have to do something equivalent to what sp economy can do for HSR characters.
    In HSR, more sp allows characters to use their skills more (and some characters to use enhanced abilities that cost multiple sp).
    Things that cost more sp (to deal more dmg for example) take time to regenerate before using again.
    This corresponds to longer cd for abilities that deal damage.
  </p><p>
    For example, Alhaitham can hold E and plunge to get 3 mirrors instantly and frontload his damage.
    His E has 18s cd, and his CA/PA mirror has 12s cd, so it would take 18s before he can get 3 mirrors again (unless using Q).
    However, if he does not frontload his damage and say CA/PA for 1 mirror, then the cd is shorter at 12s.
    Moreover, by using E for 2 mirrors and doing dps for 8s, and then CA/PA for 1 mirror to dps for another 4s,
    he is on field for 12s, and he can use his E again after 6s.
  </p><p>
    So it seems that one way sp can be translated into Genshin is via cooldowns.
  </p><p>
    When Sparkle gives 4 sp to the team via her Q,
    it is almost like resetting the cd of all teammates' abilities in Genshin.
    So each teammate can use their E, Q one more time.
  </p><p>
    Sparkle can also increase the sp cap from 5 to 7.
    It is not currently known how this can be translated into Genshin mechanics.
  </p><p>
    Her E also buffs an ally's crit dmg based on her own.
    She can also buff dmg bonus.
