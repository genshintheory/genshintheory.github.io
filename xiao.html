<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Talents">Talents</span></h2>
<p>At C0-C5 talent priority is: AA = Q &gt; E.
</p><p>At C6 talent priority is E &gt; AA = Q.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Auto-Attack">Auto-Attack</span></h3>
<p>This is closely tied to his Elemental Burst. Note that when Xiao plunge attacks, he will not take fall damage no matter what height he plunges from.
</p><p>Xiao also has the highest Normal Attack and Plunging Attack scalings among all Polearm users.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Elemental_Skill">Elemental Skill</span></h3>
<p>An excellent ability with high scaling and great for exploration. It has a 10 second cooldown and starts with 2 charges.
</p><p>By comparison, Ayaka's Elemental Skill also has a 10 second cooldown but with lower scaling and only 1 charge.
</p><p>Xiao's skill can be used midair. One can jump and cycle midair then plunge attack. The skill can traverse 5-7 meters in distance and when spammed multiple times allows Xiao to cover the greatest distance per second among any AoE DPS.
</p><p>At C1, Xiao gets 3 charges on the skill.
</p><p>At C6, Xiao gains access to 'infinite cycling'. By plunging during his burst and hitting at least two targets he gains an extra charge and can spam his skill without cooldown in the next 1s. This makes him the best sustained DPS (damage per <i>second</i>) unit in the game by far.
</p><p>Xiao can usually spam 4-6 Es within a second. One trick is to reverse the game camera to help aim Xiao's dashes. On tall enemies, Xiao can do some pretty interesting acrobatics by plunging then jumping and spamming his E.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Elemental_Burst">Elemental Burst</span></h3>
<p>This is the core of Xiao's kit. It gives him around 100% damage bonus at max level (that is additive with other damage bonuses) and greatly increases his jumping height (to around 5 meters vertically) and converts his attacks to Anemo (which cannot be overridden by any other infusion). 
</p><p>Xiao's burst increases his AoE. His High Plunge AoE goes up to 6 meters in radius, which is the highest among all plunging attacks in the game.
</p><p>During its 15 second duration, Xiao can execute around 10 high plunges.
</p><p>At C0-C5, it is optimal to spam high plunge attacks. Most other combinations involving mixing normal or charged attacks in between are either suboptimal or on par with spamming plunge attacks (you would mix in normal attacks if you are using Xiao with Beidou, Xingqiu, Yelan, etc).
</p><p>At C6 against multiple enemies, it becomes optimal to plunge and then spam his skill for the next 1s and then repeat.
</p><p>The burst costs 70 energy, which is less than Ayaka's 80 energy cost burst and Raiden's 90 energy cost burst. Pairing Xiao with an Anemo battery like Venti, Sucrose, or Jean can help Xiao gain his burst back on cooldown. The burst has an 18 second cooldown, giving Xiao at least 3 seconds of downtime.
</p><p>Xiao's burst drains his health (essentially applying corrosion to himself) at a slow exponential decay rate. This can be countered by pairing Xiao with a healer (such as Jean or Barbara) or even C6 Zhongli. The health drain can be helpful to reach low HP if one uses the Staff of Homa on Xiao.
</p><p>Being able to jump also allows Xiao to avoid many enemy attacks in the game by himself, unlike Hu Tao or Ganyu who will either have to dodge or use a shield.
</p>
  
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Constellations">Constellations</span></h2>
<ol>
  <li>C1: gives an extra charge for E, gives some extra damage and terrain traversal</li>
  <li>C2: gives more energy generation, which is ok</li>
  <li>C3: increases level of E by 3, which is great for C6</li>
  <li>C4: increases DEF by 100% when under 50% HP. This makes it a bit more comfy to fight under 50% HP, but is usually not needed if running Xiao with a shield and if using Bennett. Still it can make running Xiao with Homa an even more viable option now, and it can make Xiao as tanky as Itto.</li>
  <li>C5: increases level of Q by 3</li>
  <li>C6: This is the best C6 in the game and is what takes Xiao several leagues above all other DPS. If there is any character worth C6-ing it is Xiao. And if you're considering pulling for Xiao constellations, you may as well go all the way to C6.</li>
</ol>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Build">Build</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Artifacts">Artifacts</span></h3>
<p>In Version 2.6, the vermillion set (辰砂往生录) was released. It is Xiao's bis artifact set.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>4 piece Vermillion: 2p gives 18% atk, 4p gives additional 48% when using burst and losing hp (basically a ttds buff)</li>
  <li>2 piece Viridescent Venerer, 2 piece Gladiator: 2 piece Gladiator can be replaced with 2 piece Shimenawa for the ATK increase.
    This is bis for C6 Xiao who wants the 15% dmg bonus on his E (note the massive ~100% dmg bonus from his Q applies to just his plunging and infused attacks). At C6 most of Xiao's damage is from his E.
    For C0-C5 it can also be bis if the substats are good.
  </li>
  <li>4 piece Desert Chronicle: this gives NA atk spd and dmg bonus on NA/CA/PA for 15s. 
    While the 15s effect does align with his 15s burst, the set is not recommended 
    as Xiao gets so much damage bonus anyways and prefers attack from something like Vermillion.
    Moreover at C6, most of his damage is from his E, which Chronicle 4p will not buff.
  </li>
  <li>2 piece Shimenawa, 2 piece Gladiator: for C0-C5 it can be competitive with 2 vv 2 glad</li>
  </ul>
<p>Which one is better depends on substats. The reason 2 Shime 2 Glad can be best in slot is that Xiao has so much damage bonus already,
  so getting more ATK may balance his stats a bit more.
</p><p>Currently, no other artifact set is worth investing into.
</p>
  
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Artifact_Stats">Artifact Stats</span></h3>
<p>Aim for ATK% on the sands, Anemo DMG Bonus on the goblet, and CRIT on the circlet (CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG depending on your substats).
</p><p>For substats, CRIT &gt; ATK &gt; ER.
</p><p>Xiao naturally has the highest Base ATK in the game and gains CRIT Rate on ascension. This allows one to invest more into other CRIT stats including CRIT Damage.
</p>
  
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Weapons">Weapons</span></h3>
<p>Xiao has 2 top tier weapons that stand above all others:
</p>
<ul><li>Primordial Jade Winged Spear: gives solid CRIT Rate and a high Base ATK. It is Xiao's most consistent weapon and BiS, especially if you're running him with Bennett or a C6 Zhongli that heals him above 50%. Moreover, it matches Xiao's aesthetic and is more obtainable through the gacha (part of the Standard Banner).</li>
<li>Staff of Homa: gives a lot of CRIT DMG and can be Xiao's BiS under 50% HP, giving more damage in that situation where the passive buff is fully activated. Xiao's C4 almost encourages using the Homa as well. Above 50% HP it is still decent but PJWS is better in that case.</li></ul>
<p>Besides these 2 weapons, Xiao has a number of solid choices:
</p>
<ul><li>Skyward Spine: gives some CRIT Rate, ER, and a high base ATK. It is solid for comfortable gameplay.</li>
<li>Vortex Vanquisher: it is ok when using a shield, but would almost never recommend pulling for.</li>
<li>Engulfing Lightning: gives a ton of ER, but usually Skyward Spine is better. This weapon is really only suited on Raiden.</li></ul>
<dl><dt>4 stars</dt></dl>
<ul><li>Deathmatch: budget PJWS</li>
<li>Blackcliff Pole: budget Homa</li>
<li>Crescent Pike: Physical Xiao is more a meme, but viable since Xiao has the highest scalings on his normal attacks among polearm users. However, it is almost always much better to build Anemo DMG on Xiao.</li>
<li>Prototype Starglitter: budget Skyward Spine</li></ul>
<p>Most other polearms are typically not worth investing into. Note that the Catch's passive does not work for Xiao as Xiao's burst functions as a buff (rather than a stance change like Raiden's burst).
</p>
  
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Teams">Teams</span></h2>
<p>Xiao excels individually and can dish out high DPS even alone. Unlike some other units like Hu Tao (who relies on Xingqiu), Xiao is not too reliant on supports.
</p><p>That said, his teammates can also further boost his damage, and Xiao's versatility gives him more freedom and flexibility in choosing teams.
</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Supports">Supports</span></h3>
<p>Here are some of Xiao's best supports:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Faruzan: Morax used to be one of Xiao's best res shredders. But now there is a new queen in the game: Faruzan, who shreds anemo res, buffs anemo dmg, crit damage, additive damage, provides CC, sub-dps. Faruzan, especially C6 Faruzan, is undoubtedly the best Xiao support in the game.</li>
  <li>Morax: there are few ways to increase Anemo DMG in the game, and Zhongli's shield is one of them. Zhongli's shield reduces Anemo RES of enemies, which is very hard to do. By contrast, Viridescent Venerer and Superconduct can both decrease the RES of every other element and are very accessible for F2P. Moreover, Zhongli provides a shield for Xiao that at C6 can even heal Xiao to counter the health drain.</li>
<li>Bennett: Unlike Hu Tao, Xiao benefits greatly from Bennett and his ATK buff. The AoE of Bennett's Burst is 6m in radius, aligning perfectly with Xiao's plunging AoE. Moreover, Bennett can heal Xiao, making Bennett one of Xiao's best supports.</li>
<li>Venti: Venti excels at energy generation and crowd control, pulling enemies close enough together for Xiao to plunge attack on them at once. A common trick when pairing Xiao and Venti is for Xiao to jump and cycle against enemies within Venti's burst. Venti's burst does not last for too long, leaving time for Xiao to plunge attack on them after the enemies have been grouped together. At higher constellations, Venti can also reduce Anemo RES.</li>
<li>Sucrose: similar to Venti and can generate a lot of Anemo particles and CC enemies for Xiao. Sucrose can also use Thrilling Tales to buff Xiao's ATK even further. Sucrose's burst will not lift some enemies unlike Venti's burst, so this can make Sucrose sometimes a better support for Xiao as then Xiao can more easily plunge on enemies within Sucrose's burst.</li>
<li>Jean: plays the role of both healer and Anemo battery for Xiao. At higher constellations, Jean can also reduce Anemo RES.</li>
<li>Albedo: usually paired with Zhongli for Geo Resonance. Albedo provides some extra auxiliary damage and at higher constellations can boost Plunging damage even further.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some of Xiao's best supports are just the best supports in the game period. Xiao can use a C6 Morax or Bennett unlike other characters like Hu Tao.
</p><p>For wishes, Xiao mains should prioritize getting Faruzan, Venti, and Morax over other supports.
</p><p>Regarding Anemo RES shred, at C0, Faruzan is the best option for reducing Anemo RES by 30% (Morax is next best).
  But at higher constellations, C4 Jean and obviously C6 Venti powercreep Zhongli in reducing Anemo RES.
  Even C6 Anemo Traveler reduces Anemo RES by 20%.
  C6 Venti reduces Anemo RES by up to 44%, which makes him one of the best boosters to Xiao's damage.
  C4 Jean reduces Anemo RES by 40% within her Q, which is also amazing.
  So Venti and Jean make Zhongli look like a joke.
  At higher constellations, a C6 Zhongli is really only used for his shield and healing for Xiao.
  Xiao's best C6 supports are still Venti/Jean, Zhongli, Bennett.
  It's just that a C6 Venti will boost Xiao's damage more than Zhongli.
  </p><p>
  Some people complain whenever Venti cannot lift enemies with his ultimate.
  But this is actually a buff for Xiao.
  Whenever Venti cannot lift enemies, Xiao can plunge on them.
  </p><p>
  C6 Venti and C6 Zhongli are tailor made supports for Xiao.
  There is no other character in the game that benefits as much from C6 Venti and C6 Zhongli simultaneously
  than Xiao.
  </p><p>
  The idiotic USA media is full of lies and garbage most of the time.
  Do not listen to them.
  </p>
  
  <p>The following supports are also good or viable:</p>
<ol><li>Barbara: can heal and use Thrilling Tales. Unlike Bennett's field, Barbara's healing will follow Xiao wherever he goes, making her one of Xiao's best healers.</li>
<li>Diona: can shield and heal Xiao. She is a good replacement for Zhongli if one does not have him.</li>
<li>Raiden Shogun: Raiden can also generate energy for Xiao and act as a sub-DPS during Xiao's downtime. Her skill like Albedo's can also provide extra damage for Xiao, who attacks frequently during his burst. But usually, pairing Xiao with an Anemo battery will give him enough energy.</li>
<li>Mona: can provide DMG Bonus with her burst and off field damage with her skill. The DMG bonus is nice, but Xiao already gets so much DMG bonus from his burst that it may hit diminishing returns.</li>
<li>Ganyu/Layla: can provide off-field damage with her skill and burst for Xiao.</li>
<li>Yoimiya: can provide an ATK buff with her burst and act as a sub-DPS for Xiao.</li>
<li>Other shield characters: Noelle, Xinyan, Beidou, Thoma, etc. are ok for Xiao, but currently Xiao's best shielders include Diona and Zhongli.</li>
<li>Kokomi is ok for Xiao, but usually one can just use Barbara. Kokomi's jellyfish does not follow Xiao around, whereas Barbara's healing can.</li>
<li>Yelan for dmg bonus and sub-dps, Beidou for sub-dps, Xingqiu: when using these characters will need to interweave NA/CA between plunges</li>
<li>Besides Albedo, sub-dps units such as Yae Miko, Dehya, Xiangling, Fischl, and even Nahida can work (swirl can proc Nahida E), etc.</li>
<li>Kaedehara Kazuha: like Venti and Sucrose, can also generate energy and CC enemies. Plus, for those who believe in Plunging supremacy, it can be satisfying to pair the two premier plunging characters together on the team. It is common to see the Xiao-Kazuha pair for Abyss teams and exploration.</li>
</ol>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Example_Teams">Example Teams</span></h3>
<p>Xiao's teams are some of the most powerful in the game and can consistently clear Abyss floors with ease. Xiao excels in the Abyss and regularly sees high-end Abyss usage.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Xiao-Faruzan-C4 Jean-Bennett (top 1 or 2 for maximizing Xiao's own damage)</li>
  <li>Xiao-Faruzan-Mona-Bennett: nuke team (for the 5s window of Mona's omen buff)</li>
  <li>Xiao-Faruzan-Nahida/Dehya/Yae/Yelan/Albedo-Bennett: to add sub-dps for Xiao</li>
  <li>Xiao-Venti-Bennett-Zhongli (team of gods)</li>
  <li>Xiao-Sucrose-Bennett-Zhongli</li>
  <li>Xiao-Jean-Albedo-Zhongli (team is decent, but usually teams with Xiao-Bennett have higher DPS)</li>
  <li>Xiao-Bennett-Albedo-Zhongli (if Xiao has enough ER or does not need an Anemo Battery)</li>
  <li>Xiao-Venti-Bennett-Diona</li>
  <li>Xiao-Sucrose-Bennett-Diona (F2P friendly team)</li>
  <li>Xiao-Sucrose-Bennett-Barbara (F2P friendly team)</li>
  <li>Xiao-Kazuha-Bennett-Zhongli (Plunging supremacy)</li>
  <li>Xiao-Venti-Mona-Diona (better version of Morgana)</li>
</ol>
<p>These other teams are usable for fun and viable in Abyss, but the above teams are usually more recommended:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Xiao-Venti-Tartaglia-Bennett (the Tartar team: Tartaglia increases Xiao's AA by +1, enabling Xiao to do more plunge damage; Tartaglia can also act as a sub-DPS during Xiao's downtime and has a great burst too)</li>
  <li>Xiao-Raiden-Bennett-Venti</li>
  <li>Xiao-Raiden-Bennett-Zhongli</li>
  <li>Xiao-Yoimiya-Bennett-Diona</li>
  <li>Xiao-Yoimiya-Raiden-Bennett</li>
</ol>
  
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Calculations">Calculations</span></h2>
<p>Here we assume talent levels 10-10-10. These focus mostly on MVs. We assume that Xiao has an Anemo DMG Bonus goblet and is running 2 piece VV (which gives up to 61.6% Anemo Damage Bonus). We ignore other buffs (like a Bennett or Zhongli buff).
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="C0">C0</span></h3>
<p>The scaling for one high plunge attack during his burst is
</p>
<dl><dd>\( z=404*(1+.952+.616)=1037.472 \)</dd></dl>
<p>We assume Xiao does 10 high plunge attacks for the duration of his 15 second burst (so 1 high plunge every 1.5 seconds). The total scaling is then 
</p>
<dl><dd>\( 10z=10374.72 \)</dd></dl>
<p>This DPS is
</p>
<dl><dd> \( x_0 = z/1.5=691.648\) </dd></dl>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="C6">C6</span></h3>
<p>Note that the Q gains 3 levels so the buff becomes 108.85% damage bonus. The E also gains 3 levels.
</p><p>From the previous section, we assume 1 high plunge takes 1.5 seconds. After high plunging, Xiao then spams his E say for 4 times at minimum (though he can reach 5-6) within the next second. So a rotation takes 2.5 seconds and consists of the 2 parts:
</p>
<dl><dd>\( y=404*(1+1.0885+.616)+4*537*(1+.616)=4563.786 \)</dd></dl>
<p>So at C6 most of Xiao's damage comes from his E.
</p><p>For the duration of 15 seconds, we assume he does this for \( 15/2.5=6\) times so the total scaling is then
</p>
<dl><dd>\(6y=27382.716\)</dd></dl>
<p>The DPS is
</p>
  <dl><dd>\(x_6 = y/2.5 = 1825.5144\)</dd></dl>
<p>So Xiao's DPS is nearly tripled at C6 compared to C0.
</p>
  <p>
    Note these calculations do not factor in Xiao's 2 passives which further increase his DMG Bonus.
    So in practice, he can do more damage than this.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of his passives increases damage of E by 15% each time it is used, up to 3 stacks for a total of 45% bonus.
    Each stack lasts 7s, and its duration is refreshed when a new stack is gained.
    Given how fast Xiao attacks with his E, it is very easy to have the max bonus of 45% for basically the whole duration
    (use Xiao's E 3 times before casting his Q to get max stacks).
    Recomputing the dps gives
  </p>
  <dl><dd>\( y=404*(1+1.0885+.616)+4*537*(1+.616+.45)=5530.386 \)</dd></dl>
  <dl><dd>\(x_6 = y/2.5 = 2212.1544\)</dd></dl>
  <p>This is around a ~20% increase in dps, which is pretty significant.</p>
  <p>
    Lastly Xiao has a passive that increases all damage by 5% over time, up to 25%.
    This has not yet been factored into the calculations, but it would increase his dps even further.
  </p>

  <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="midair">Midair plunge damage (pierce/collision damage)</span></h3>
  <p>
    For some bigger enemies (e.g. bosses like the vishaps or maguu kenki),
    Xiao can also do some additional 'pierce' or 'midair' damage while plunging.
    Basically if Xiao plunges on top of the enemy's hitbox, he will do another instance of damage before hitting the ground.
    There have been some interesting tricks using this. 
    For example, using the Geo Traveler's ultimate and then plunging on top of the ridges 
    can make Xiao enter an 'infinite loop' of plunging while doing continuous midair plunge damage.
  </p><p>
    This pierce plunge damage has scaling 161.76% at NA Level 10.
    It becomes significant against the bigger enemies as mentioned before and contributes a decent amount of dps.
    Specifically, compared to a high plunge multiplier of 404%, the midair plunge damage is about 40% of that value.
    So if we assume Xiao can do one instance of midair plunge damage for each high plunge,
    then we get a dps increase of around 40% (a 1.4 multiplier, which is quite significant).
    For C0 Xiao, this increases his single-target dps against bigger bosses to
  </p>
  <dl><dd>\(1.4x_0 = 968.3072\)</dd></dl>
  <p>
    Even without the midair plunge damage, C0 Xiao's single target dps is already the highest among C0 units (the bonus is that it is aoe).
    With the midair plunge damage, C0 Xiao's dps becomes higher than many C6 units.
  </p>

  <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="skill">Skill damage</span></h3>
  <p>Xiao can also use his E outside his burst too.
    This will contribute to his C0 damage.
    At lv10 it has 455% scaling. Assume he uses it once every 10s 
    (because he has charges, even after his 15s he can save up charges over time 
    so on average it effectively becomes once every 10s). 
    Outside his burst, the dps is
    $$x_e = 455*1.616/10 = 73.5$$
  </p><p>
    Total c0 dps is then
    $$x_e + x_0 = 765.1$$
    and with collision damage
    $$x_e + 1.4x_0 = 1041.8$$
    Xiao's individual c0 dps can surpass many characters' c6 dps.    
  </p>

  <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Trivia">Trivia</span></h2>
  <ul>
  <li>In the English version of the game in the fight against Osial, Xiao says that his name means 'Swiftness'. 
  His name in Chinese 魈 refers to a kind of demon. 
  But the English localization basically illustrates that for Xiao, speed is a huge part of his DPS and kit.</li>
