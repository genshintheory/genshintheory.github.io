  ;Effective Version 2.2

Xiao is an Anemo polearm user and yaksha guardian of Liyue with the highest DPS potential in the game.

With the highest base ATK in the game, Xiao is a top-tier AoE unit that excels at plunging attacks. He is very agile and excellent for exploration as well.

== Talents ==
At C0-C5 talent priority is: AA = Q > E.

At C6 talent priority is E > AA = Q.

=== Auto-Attack ===
This is closely tied to his Elemental Burst. Note that when Xiao plunge attacks, he will not take fall damage no matter what height he plunges from.

Xiao also has the highest Normal Attack and Plunging Attack scalings among all Polearm users.

=== Elemental Skill ===
An excellent ability with high scaling and great for exploration. It has a 10 second cooldown and starts with 2 charges.

By comparison, Ayaka's Elemental Skill also has a 10 second cooldown but with lower scaling and only 1 charge.

Xiao's skill can be used midair. One can jump and cycle midair then plunge attack. The skill can traverse 5-7 meters in distance and when spammed multiple times allows Xiao to cover the greatest distance per second among any AoE DPS.

At C1, Xiao gets 3 charges on the skill.

At C6, Xiao gains access to 'infinite cycling'. By plunging during his burst and hitting at least two targets he gains an extra charge and can spam his skill without cooldown in the next 1s. This makes him the best sustained DPS (damage per ''second'') unit in the game by far.

Xiao can usually spam 4-6 Es within a second. One trick is to reverse the game camera to help aim Xiao's dashes. On tall enemies, Xiao can do some pretty interesting acrobatics by plunging then jumping and spamming his E.

=== Elemental Burst ===
This is the core of Xiao's kit. It gives him around 100% damage bonus at max level (that is additive with other damage bonuses) and greatly increases his jumping height (to around 5 meters vertically) and converts his attacks to Anemo (which cannot be overridden by any other infusion). 

Xiao's burst increases his AoE. His High Plunge AoE goes up to 6 meters in radius, which is the highest among all plunging attacks in the game.

During its 15 second duration, Xiao can execute around 10 high plunges.

At C0-C5, it is optimal to spam high plunge attacks. Most other combinations involving mixing normal or charged attacks in between is either suboptimal or on par with spamming plunge attacks.

At C6 against multiple enemies, it becomes optimal to plunge and then spam his skill for the next 1s and then repeat.

The burst costs 70 energy, which is less than Ayaka's 80 energy cost burst and Raiden's 90 energy cost burst. Pairing Xiao with an Anemo battery like Venti, Sucrose, or Jean can help Xiao gain his burst back on cooldown. The burst has an 18 second cooldown, giving Xiao at least 3 seconds of downtime.

Xiao's burst drains his health (essentially applying corrosion to himself) at a slow exponential decay rate. This can be countered by pairing Xiao with a healer (such as Jean or Barbara) or even C6 Zhongli. The health drain can be helpful to reach low HP if one uses the Staff of Homa on Xiao.

Being able to jump also allows Xiao to avoid many enemy attacks in the game by himself, unlike Hu Tao or Ganyu who will either have to dodge or use a shield.

== Constellations ==
# C1: gives an extra charge for E, gives some extra damage and terrain traversal
# C2: gives more energy generation, which is ok
# C3: increases level of E by 3, which is great for C6
# C4: increases DEF by 100% when under 50% HP. This makes it a bit more comfy to fight under 50% HP, but is usually not needed if running Xiao with a shield and if using Bennett. Still it can make running Xiao with Homa an even more viable option now.
# C5: increases level of Q by 3
# C6: This is the best C6 in the game and is what takes Xiao several leagues above all other DPS. If there is any character worth C6-ing it is Xiao. And if you're considering pulling for Xiao constellations, you may as well go all the way to C6.

== Build ==
=== Artifacts ===
Since Version 1.3, Xiao has not had a dedicated artifact set made for him. His current best in slot is:
* 2 piece Viridescent Venerer, 2 piece Gladiator
Here 2 piece Gladiator can be replaced with 2 piece Shimenawa for the ATK increase.

Currently, no other artifact set is worth investing into.

=== Artifact Stats ===
Aim for ATK% on the sands, Anemo DMG Bonus on the goblet, and CRIT on the circlet (CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG depending on your substats).

For substats, CRIT > ATK > ER.

Xiao naturally has the highest Base ATK in the game and gains CRIT Rate on ascension. This allows one to invest more into other CRIT stats including CRIT Damage.

=== Weapons ===
Xiao has 2 top tier weapons that stand above all others:
* Primordial Jade Winged Spear: gives solid CRIT Rate and a high Base ATK. It is Xiao's most consistent weapon and BiS, especially if you're running him with Bennett or a C6 Zhongli that heals him above 50%. Moreover, it matches Xiao's aesthetic and is more obtainable through the gacha (part of the Standard Banner).
* Staff of Homa: gives a lot of CRIT DMG and can be Xiao's BiS under 50% HP, giving more damage in that situation where the passive buff is fully activated. Xiao's C4 almost encourages using the Homa as well. Above 50% HP it is still decent but PJWS is better in that case.

Besides these 2 weapons, Xiao has a number of solid choices:
* Skyward Spine: gives some CRIT Rate, ER, and a high base ATK. It is solid for comfortable gameplay.
* Vortex Vanquisher: it is ok when using a shield, but would almost never recommend pulling for.
* Engulfing Lightning: gives a ton of ER, but usually Skyward Spine is better. This weapon is really only suited on Raiden.

;4 stars
* Deathmatch: budget PJWS
* Blackcliff Pole: budget Homa
* Crescent Pike: Physical Xiao is more a meme, but viable since Xiao has the highest scalings on his normal attacks among polearm users. However, it is almost always much better to build Anemo DMG on Xiao.
* Prototype Starglitter: budget Skyward Spine

Most other polearms are typically not worth investing into. Note that the Catch's passive does not work for Xiao as Xiao's burst functions as a buff (rather than a stance change like Raiden's burst).

== Teams ==
Xiao excels individually and can dish out high DPS even alone. Unlike some other units like Hu Tao (who relies on Xingqiu), Xiao is not too reliant on supports.

That said, his teammates can also further boost his damage, and Xiao's versatility gives him more freedom and flexibility in choosing teams.

=== Supports ===
Here are some of Xiao's best supports:
# Zhongli: there are few ways to increase Anemo DMG in the game, and Zhongli's shield is one of them. Zhongli's shield reduces Anemo RES of enemies, which is very hard to do. By contrast, Viridescent Venerer and Superconduct can both decrease the RES of every other element and are very accessible for F2P. Moreover, Zhongli provides a shield for Xiao that at C6 can even heal Xiao to counter the health drain.
# Bennett: Unlike Hu Tao, Xiao benefits greatly from Bennett and his ATK buff. The AoE of Bennett's Burst is 6m in radius, aligning perfectly with Xiao's plunging AoE. Moreover, Bennett can heal Xiao, making Bennett one of Xiao's best supports.
# Venti: Venti excels at energy generation and crowd control, pulling enemies close enough together for Xiao to plunge attack on them at once. A common trick when pairing Xiao and Venti is for Xiao to jump and cycle against enemies within Venti's burst. Venti's burst does not last for too long, leaving time for Xiao to plunge attack on them after the enemies have been grouped together. At higher constellations, Venti can also reduce Anemo RES.
# Sucrose: similar to Venti and can generate a lot of Anemo particles and CC enemies for Xiao. Sucrose can also use Thrilling Tales to buff Xiao's ATK even further. Sucrose's burst will not lift some enemies unlike Venti's burst, so this can make Sucrose sometimes a better support for Xiao as then Xiao can more easily plunge on enemies within Sucrose's burst.
# Jean: plays the role of both healer and Anemo battery for Xiao. At higher constellations, Jean can also reduce Anemo RES.
# Albedo: usually paired with Zhongli for Geo Resonance. Albedo provides some extra auxiliary damage and at higher constellations can boost Plunging damage even further.

Some of Xiao's best supports are just the best supports in the game period. Xiao can use a C6 Zhongli or Bennett unlike other characters like Hu Tao.

For wishes, Xiao mains should prioritize getting Venti and Zhongli over other supports.

The following supports are also good or viable:
# Barbara: can heal and use Thrilling Tales. Unlike Bennett's field, Barbara's healing will follow Xiao wherever he goes, making her one of Xiao's best healers.
# Diona: can shield and heal Xiao. She is a good replacement for Zhongli if one does not have him.
# Raiden Shogun: Raiden can also generate energy for Xiao and act as a sub-DPS during Xiao's downtime. Her skill like Albedo's can also provide extra damage for Xiao, who attacks frequently during his burst. But usually, pairing Xiao with an Anemo battery will give him enough energy.
# Kaedehara Kazuha: like Venti and Sucrose, can also generate energy and CC enemies. Plus, for those who believe in Plunging supremacy, it can be satisfying to pair the two premier plunging characters together on the team. It is common to see the Xiao-Kazuha pair for Abyss teams and exploration.
# Mona: can provide DMG Bonus with her burst and off field damage with her skill. The DMG bonus is nice, but Xiao already gets so much DMG bonus from his burst that it may hit diminishing returns.
# Ganyu: can provide off-field damage with her skill and burst for Xiao.
# Yoimiya: can provide an ATK buff with her burst and act as a sub-DPS for Xiao.
# Other shield characters: Noelle, Xinyan, Beidou, Thoma, etc. are ok for Xiao, but currently Xiao's best shielders are Diona and Zhongli.
# Other characters like Fischl and Xingqiu are ok for Xiao, but Xiao usually has better supports.
# Kokomi is ok for Xiao, but usually one can just use Barbara. Kokomi's jellyfish does not follow Xiao around, whereas Barbara's healing can.

=== Example Teams ===
Xiao's teams are some of the most powerful in the game and can consistently clear Abyss floors with ease. Xiao excels in the Abyss and regularly sees high-end Abyss usage.
# Xiao-Venti-Bennett-Zhongli (team of gods)
# Xiao-Sucrose-Bennett-Zhongli
# Xiao-Jean-Albedo-Zhongli (team is decent, but usually teams with Xiao-Bennett have higher DPS)
# Xiao-Bennett-Albedo-Zhongli (if Xiao has enough ER or does not need an Anemo Battery)
# Xiao-Venti-Bennett-Diona
# Xiao-Sucrose-Bennett-Diona (F2P friendly team)
# Xiao-Sucrose-Bennett-Barbara (F2P friendly team)
# Xiao-Kazuha-Bennett-Zhongli (Plunging supremacy)
# Xiao-Venti-Mona-Diona (better version of Morgana)

These other teams are usable for fun and viable in Abyss, but the above teams are usually more recommended:
# Xiao-Venti-Tartaglia-Bennett (the Tartar team: Tartaglia increases Xiao's AA by +1, enabling Xiao to do more plunge damage; Tartaglia can also act as a sub-DPS during Xiao's downtime and has a great burst too)
# Xiao-Raiden-Bennett-Venti
# Xiao-Raiden-Bennett-Zhongli
# Xiao-Yoimiya-Bennett-Diona
# Xiao-Yoimiya-Raiden-Bennett

== Trivia ==
* In the English version of the game in the fight against Osial, Xiao says that his name means 'Swiftness'. His name in Chinese 魈 refers to a kind of demon. But the English localization basically illustrates that for Xiao, speed is a huge part of his DPS and kit.

== Calculations ==
Here we assume talent levels 10-10-10. These focus mostly on MVs. We assume that Xiao has an Anemo DMG Bonus goblet and is running 2 piece VV (which gives up to 61.6% Anemo Damage Bonus). We ignore other buffs (like a Bennett or Zhongli buff).<!--also ignore ATK speed buff from things like Anemo Resonance-->

=== C0 ===
The scaling for one high plunge attack during his burst is
:<math>x = 404*(1 + .952 + .616) = 1037.472</math>
We assume Xiao does 10 high plunge attacks for the duration of his 15 second burst (so 1 high plunge every 1.5 seconds). The total scaling is then 
:<math>10x = 10374.72</math>
This DPS is
:<math>x/1.5 = 691.648</math>

=== C6 ===
Note that the Q gains 3 levels so the buff becomes 108.85% damage bonus. The E also gains 3 levels.

From the previous section, we assume 1 high plunge takes 1.5 seconds. After high plunging, Xiao then spams his E say for 4 times at minimum (though he can reach 5-6) within the next second. So a rotation takes 2.5 seconds and consists of the 2 parts:
:<math>y = 404*(1 + 1.0885 + .616) + 4*537*(1 + .616) = 4563.786</math>
So at C6 most of Xiao's damage comes from his E.

For the duration of 15 seconds, we assume he does this for <math>15/2.5 = 6</math> times so the total scaling is then
:<math>6y = 27382.716</math>
The DPS is
:<math>y/2.5 = 1825.5144</math>
So Xiao's DPS is nearly tripled at C6 compared to C0.
