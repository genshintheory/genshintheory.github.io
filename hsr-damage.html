  <p>Damage is calculated as 
    base damage 
    times damage bonus
    times crit multiplier 
    times defense multiplier
    times res multiplier 
    times vulnerability
    times broken/toughness multiplier.
  </p><p>
    Most of these are similar to their counterparts in Genshin.
    The new multipliers are the last two:
    vulnerability is a multiplicative damage increase.
    Characters like Jing Yuan, Himeko, etc. have skills that can increase damage taken/increase enemy vulnerability.
  </p><p>
    The toughness multiplier is related to whether their toughness gauge (armor) is broken or not.
    If it is not broken, all damage is multiplied by 0.9.
    If it is broken, it is multiplied by 1.
  </p>
  <p>Some other notes:
    the defense multiplier is calculated in a similar way as that in Genshin.
    The basic result is that if the character is lv90 and enemy is lv90,
    then the def multiplier is around 1/2 (so it halves the damage).
    The enemy's defense scales with their level, as in Genshin.
