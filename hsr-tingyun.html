  <h2>Genshin equivalent</h2>
  <p>Like Bronya, Tingyun is a universal buffer.
    Her Q restores 50 energy to a character.
    This is actually broken, compared to Genshin's standards.
    Raiden restores 12 energy.
    Of course, the energy costs and generation in HSR are different.
    But still, if 130 is a more expensive energy cost, Tingyun can restore it to full by using her Q three times.
    An equivalent in Genshin would be a character that restores say 30 energy per Q 
    (then using it thrice will cover Raiden and Yae 90 cost bursts).
    Such a character does not exist in Genshin.
  </p><p>
    Besides that Tingyun gives a universal damage bonus buff for 2 turns with her burst, similar to what Mona does.
    However Tingyun's buff is for a single ally, whereas Mona's buff is for all allies.
  </p><p>
    Tingyun also buffs attack with her skill for 3 turns (longer than Yukong).
    Moreover, the ally receiving her skill buff can deal additional lightning damage (more scaling).
