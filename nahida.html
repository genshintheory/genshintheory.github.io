  <p>Nahida (纳西妲) is a mysterious little girl.
    In 3.0, she is revealed to be the dendro archon and youngest of the archons after the previous dendro archon Rukkhadevata perished.
  </p><p>The previous dendro archon goes by the name Rukkhadevata (रुक्खदेवता), which means 'tree goddess' 
    (rukkha is tree, devata is goddess, similar to the root divine or devas in English).
    In Hinduism, Rukkhadevata is worshipped as a Yakshini, goddess of wealth, and guardian deity.
    Yakshinis are the female counterparts of the Yakshas (Xiao is a yaksha).
    It would be interesting if Xiao has any interactions with the lore of Sumeru and yakshas given his background.
