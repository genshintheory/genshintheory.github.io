  <h2>Genshin equivalent</h2>
  <p>Perhaps Kujou Sara (c6) is the closest equivalent to what Yukong does.
    Yukong's buffs atk with her skill and crit value with her burst. 
    But her buffs do not last as long as Bronya's.
    Similarly, Kujou's E buffs atk but does not last as long as Bennett's buff.
    (Kujou also buffs crit dmg with her c6, albeit for electro only.)
  </p><p>
    So perhaps the analogy is: Bronya is to Yukong what Bennett is to Kujou.
    They are just in different leagues.
  </p><p>
    And in some sense, Yukong is worse than Kujou 
    given that Yukong needs to keep consuming skill points each turn to keep the buff up (which she may not be able to do), making her buff expensive.
    Bronya at least has a passive where if she uses a basic attack to replenish a SP, she advances her action forward,
    so Bronya is much more self-sufficient.
    Moreover, Yukong cannot control who the next 2 characters move after her, whereas Kujou and Bronya have more control over who receives the buff.
    Also, C6 Kujou gives the crit buff with E (does not require Q energy cost like Yukong does).
  </p><p>
    To go further, Yukong is worse than Tingyun as a harmony unit.
    At least Tingyun's buffs can last several turns.
    So Tingyun, Bronya have more long-term durability than Yukong.
