<p>Chongyun E gives a cryo infusion.
  It can be used for breaking the shields of hydro heralds.
  For hydro heralds, one can also use dendro,
  cryo bows, cryo catalysts (Charlotte, Wrio), Ayaka.
</p><p>
  Besides that Chongyun C2 provides CD reduction.
  Some teams he can be played in are the og national,
  freeze (with Furina, Yelan, XQ),
  fridge, melt.
</p><p>
  Some other ideas people have tried with Chongyun are:
  cryo infused Eula/Shenhe/Dehya/Itto,
  melt Diluc (mix E with 2 cryo NA),
  cd reduction for Childe.
  If you are doing freeze Freminet, maybe Chongyun can pair with him.
</p>
<p>
  On Chongyun and Mika:
  both are cryo but they seem to be opposites
  as Chongyun gives cryo infusion
  whereas Mika is a physical buffer.
  But they can sort of work together
  as Mika also gives an atk spd buff.
  Perhaps they remind one of two figures who contributed to the modernization of a certain country?
