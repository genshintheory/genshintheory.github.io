<title>Genshin characters in HSR</title>

  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  <p>Just like how we design analogs of Star Rail characters in Genshin,
    we can do the reverse and design analogs of Genshin characters in Star Rail.
    In fact, the TCG of Genshin (a turn based game) provides hints on how to do this translation.
  </p><p>
    HSR has <a href='hsr-sp.html'>skill points</a> whereas TCG has elemental dice.
    In TCG, every character atk (normal, E, Q) consumes elemental dice, and the elements need to match.
    The dice are re-rolled and regenerated at the end of each round.
  </p><p>
    The sp system of HSR is a bit different: characters can regenerate sp with basic attacks and consume sp with skills.
    Bursts do not consume sp.
    Also sp can be used regardless of element. One does not need to convert elemental dice as in TCG.
    The similarity is that using skills generate energy to use bursts.
  </p>

  <p>If one thinks about it, there is actually no reason why TCG needs to use this elemental dice system at all.
    They can just adapt the sp system from HSR.
    There will be no need to end rounds and reroll dice or convert dice into different elements.
  </p><p>
    Another feature that TCG has that HSR does not is support cards.
    One can draw many supporting cards from a deck to aid the characters in combat.
    Using these supporting cards can sometimes consume dice.
    So HSR could technically introduce some system of 'supporting cards' that cost sp.
    This may require some creativity on behalf of the designers.
  </p><p>
    Also in TCG one uses 3 character teams, whereas HSR allows 4 character teams.
    This is not too big of a deal. Some games even allow up to 5 characters on a team.
    4 is probably reasonable, but 3 is a bit on the lower side.
  </p>

  <p>The damage system of TCG is much simpler than HSR.
    Cards have a low integer number of health points, and attacks usually do a few points of damage (like -2, -3).
  </p>

  <p>Also HSR lacks elemental reactions, whereas TCG has them.
    And reactions are one of things that makes TCG unique.
    <a href='hsr-damage.html'>HSR combat</a> could be greatly enhanced if it developed a TCG-like system of reactions.

  <h2>Examples: Genshin characters in Star Rail</h2>
  <p>Some of these designs may be inspired by the TCG analogs.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Xiao: Q enters yaksha mode, greatly buffs dmg bonus and enhances his NA.
      NA turns into plunge attack, where Xiao jumps into the air, avoiding damage for 1 turn, before plunging and doing aoe damage on the enemy.
      E could do blast damage on the enemy.
      E6 could allow him to use his skill 4-6 times a turn, and his skill will not consume sp.
    </li>
    <li></li>
  </ul>
