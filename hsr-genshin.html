<title>Genshin characters in HSR</title>

  <p>Just like how we design analogs of Star Rail characters in Genshin,
    we can do the reverse and design analogs of Genshin characters in Star Rail.
    In fact, the TCG of Genshin (a turn based game) provides hints on how to do this translation.
  </p><p>
    HSR has <a href='hsr-sp.html'>skill points</a> whereas TCG has elemental dice.
    In TCG, every character atk (normal, E, Q) consumes elemental dice, and the elements need to match.
    The dice are re-rolled and regenerated at the end of each round.
  </p><p>
    The sp system of HSR is a bit different: characters can regenerate sp with basic attacks and consume sp with skills.
    Bursts do not consume sp.
    Also sp can be used regardless of element. One does not need to convert elemental dice as in TCG.
    The similarity is that using skills generate energy to use bursts.
  </p>

  <p>If one thinks about it, there is actually no reason why TCG needs to use this elemental dice system at all.
    They can just adapt the sp system from HSR.
    There will be no need to end rounds and reroll dice or convert dice into different elements.
