<title>Genshin characters in HSR</title>

  </head>
  
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  <p>Just like how we design analogs of Star Rail characters in Genshin,
    we can do the reverse and design analogs of Genshin characters in Star Rail.
    In fact, the TCG of Genshin (a turn based game) provides hints on how to do this translation.
  </p><p>
    HSR has <a href='hsr-sp.html'>skill points</a> whereas TCG has elemental dice.
    In TCG, every character atk (normal, E, Q) consumes elemental dice, and the elements need to match.
    The dice are re-rolled and regenerated at the end of each round.
  </p><p>
    The sp system of HSR is a bit different: characters can regenerate sp with basic attacks and consume sp with skills.
    Bursts do not consume sp.
    Also sp can be used regardless of element. One does not need to convert elemental dice as in TCG.
    The similarity is that using skills generate energy to use bursts.
  </p>

  <p>If one thinks about it, there is actually no reason why TCG needs to use this elemental dice system at all.
    They can just adapt the sp system from HSR.
    There will be no need to end rounds and reroll dice or convert dice into different elements.
  </p><p>
    Another feature that TCG has that HSR does not is support cards.
    One can draw many supporting cards from a deck to aid the characters in combat.
    Using these supporting cards can sometimes consume dice.
    So HSR could technically introduce some system of 'supporting cards' that cost sp.
    This may require some creativity on behalf of the designers.
  </p><p>
    Also in TCG one uses 3 character teams, whereas HSR allows 4 character teams.
    This is not too big of a deal. Some games even allow up to 5 characters on a team.
    4 is probably reasonable, but 3 is a bit on the lower side.
  </p>

  <p>The damage system of TCG is much simpler than HSR.
    Cards have a low integer number of health points, and attacks usually do a few points of damage (like -2, -3).
  </p>

  <p>HSR lacks elemental reactions, whereas TCG has them.
    And reactions are one of things that makes TCG unique.
    <a href='hsr-damage.html'>HSR combat</a> could be greatly enhanced if it developed a TCG-like system of reactions.
  </p>

  <p>In Genshin and TCG, some characters can do physical damage with their NA.
    In HSR, a character will only deal damage of their specific element.
    We will follow the HSR convention below.
  </p>
  <p>Also Genshin allows NA, CA, and PA, whereas in HSR there is just one basic attack.
    To introduce CA into HSR, one can have the following mechanic:
    either CA takes 2 turns before firing
    or CA does not generate a sp (or can even consume 1 sp).
    By contrast a NA generates 1 sp.
  </p>


  <h2>Examples: Genshin characters in Star Rail</h2>
  <p>Some of these designs may be inspired by the TCG analogs.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Xiao (destruction): Q enters yaksha mode, greatly buffs NA dmg bonus (by 100%) and enhances his NA.
      NA turns into plunge attack, where Xiao jumps into the air, avoiding damage for 1 turn, before plunging and doing aoe damage on the enemy.
      E could do blast damage on the enemy.
      E1 could give 'extra charge' on skill, allowing him to use a free E once every 2-3 turns.
      E6 could allow him to use his skill 4-6 times a turn, and his skill will not consume sp.
      Xiao has passive that increases his anemo dmg bonus during yaksha mode.
      He also has another passive that increases each E use the more it is used.
      While in yaksha mode, he drains hp each turn.
    </li>
    <li>Diluc: his E does blast pyro dmg. Each E use gives a stack that increases dmg bonus of next E, up to 3 stacks.
      His Q summons a phoenix that does aoe pyro damage, while giving his basic attacks a pyro enchantment. 
      This gives him 20% dmg bonus and allows his basic attacks to do blast pyro damage for 2-3 turns.
    </li>
    <li>Mona (harmony): E creates a '5th character' on field that taunts the enemy and draws their aggro/attacks for 2-3 turns.
      Q does nuke of hydro damage while buffing all characters' dmg bonus by 60%.
    </li>
    <li>Bennett (harmony/abundance): E does pyro dmg, Q buffs all allies' atk based on his base atk for 2-3 turns.
    </li>
    <li>Morax: E gievs all allies a shield that shreds all res of enemies by 20%. 
      Q summons meteor to do aoe geo nuke on all enemies, while petrifying them for 1 turn.
    </li>
    <li>Childe (destruction): CA applies riptide to one enemy. E enters stance for up to 5 turns.
      The longer he is in E mode, the longer the cd. Using E costs 1 sp.
      His NA are converted to blast hydro damage. His crit hits can apply riptide to enemies (or can leverage effect hit rate).
      Enemies affected by riptide when hit by hydro will suffer an additional blast of hydro dmg, hitting themselves and surrounding enemies.
      Q does nuke of hydro damage.
      If used outside of E mode, it does blast dmg and applies riptide to enemies.
      It used within E mode, it does aoe dmg and clears riptide from enemies, while dealing additional blast hydro dmg to enemies who had their riptide cleared.
      Passive makes enemies with riptide who are defeated to spread riptide to surrounding enemies.
    </li>
    <li>Scaramouche: NA does single target anemo, CA does blast.
      E allows him to hover for 2-3 turns, which decreases the chance that he is hit (what else can it do in HSR?).
      The E cd is 1 turn. Using E costs 1 sp.
      E also gives a multiplier to his NA and CA, while increasing their aoe. NA can do blast dmg, while CA does aoe dmg.
      Q does aoe nuke.
      C1 increases his speed (there is no 'atk spd' in HSR).
      C2 increases his Q dmg based on how long he is in the hover state.
    </li>
    <li>Raiden: E does coordinated blast electro dmg every time character attacks enemy.
      E also buffs burst dmg of allies.
      Raiden has chakra which accumulates stacks whenever characters use their bursts.
      Q does aoe nuke that scales with number of chakra stacks.
      It also gives electro infusion to Raiden for 2 turns.
      Raiden's NA do blast electro dmg and have increased scaling based on chakra stacks, while also restoring energy to all allies.
    </li>
    <li>Yae: E creates summon that does electro dmg each turn to random enemy. Can use E up to 3 times to create 3 summons.
      Q consumes each summon to deal blast nuke of electro dmg.
    </li>
    <li>Eula: so Eula relies on superconduct. Suppose superconduct has been implemented in HSR.
      E gives 1 grimheart stack and costs 1 sp. Hold E consumes all stacks and costs 2 sp.
      If 1 grimheart stack is consumed, shreds physical res.
      If 2 grimheart stacks are consumed, shreds physical res and does aoe nuke of physical dmg.
      Q does aoe cryo dmg, gives 1 grimheart stack, summons lightsword that lasts 2 turns,
      gives 1 sp, and advances Eula's action forward by 100%.
      When teammates damage enemies, they will generate 1 energy stack for the lightsword.
      At the end of 2 turns, the lightsword explodes, dealing aoe physical dmg scaling with the number of energy stacks.
    </li>
    <li>Venti: the vacuum cc abilities seem very Genshin specific, related to its 3d physics and gravity.
      Venti E can lift an enemy into the air, immobilizing them for 1 turn.
      Venti Q does aoe anemo dot, while lifting all enemies in the air and immobilizing them for 3 turns.
      If the Q comes into contact with pyro, elector, hydro, cryo, it will absorb that element 
      and deal additional dot of that absorbed element.
      Assuming swirl is implemented in HSR, the Q can also swirl the absorbed element.
      Venti would be very broken in HSR if he could lift all enemies.
      So perhaps some measures to impose a weight limit could be enacted, as is the case in Genshin.
    </li>
  </ul>
