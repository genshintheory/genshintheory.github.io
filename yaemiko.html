    <title>Yae Miko</title>

  <div id="includedContent"></div>
<p><b>Yae Miko</b> (八重神子) owns a book store.
  She is the reason why many people skipped Ganyu and Zhongli.
  Yae is also a good upgrade from and replacement for Fischl.
</p>

<h2>Talents</h2>
<p>Yae is similar to Albedo in that she has 100% uptime on her E and provides off field damage.
  In this way, Yae is designed like a sub-dps.
  While one can play her as an on-field auto-attacking dps, 
  the scalings on her normal attacks are not the highest.
  Instead, it is usually recommended to focus more on investing into her E and Q,
  which together contribute the majority of her dps.
</p>

<h3>Elemental Skill: Sesshou Sakura (杀生樱)</h3>
<p>
  Most of Yae's damage is from her E, which has 100% uptime and is off field.
  The range on Yae's E allows her to hit flying enemies like oceanid birds, specters, and eyes of storm
  (whereas Albedo's E may not always be able to).
  The only downside is that it is single target. Even the Electro samachurl totems do AoE pulses.
</p>

<h3>Elemental Burst</h3>
<p>
	The scaling on this is quite high.
  It has a 90 energy cost like Raiden's burst.
  Unlike Raiden's burst (17s cd), Yae's burst has a 22s cd.
  It is recommended to use a battery for Yae as her Q contributes a non-trivial amount to her overall dps.
  Raiden is one of her best teammates, especially as a battery, but if one does not have Raiden, Fischl is an ok budget option.
</p><p>
  Each lightning strike applies 1a electro with no icd (or short enough icd)
  so that electro is applied on each hit.
</p>

<h3>EM passive</h3>
<p>
  Yae has a passive that converts EM to dmg bonus on her E (.15% dmg bonus per EM point).
  This just makes EM a more useful substat on artifacts, but it is still not recommended to stack EM on the weapon or as a main stat on artifacts.
  Having it as a substat suffices.
</p><p>
  Technically, if Yae gets 1000 EM (a tall order), she can get 150% dmg bonus.
  But usually one builds Yae as a normal dps (no EM as main stat on the artifact).
  And even if Yae gets 150% dmg bonus, Raiden can basically reach that level just with her ER conversion.
  Xiao is basically the only other character that can have higher total innate dmg bonus than Raiden at C0.
  Other than that, Mona (with her omen buff) and a C6 Kazuha can also reach a similar level of dmg bonus. 
  C6 Kazuha gets .2% dmg bonus per EM point, but that is at C6 only (and for 5s at a time).
</p>

<h2>Constellations</h2>
<p>
  Yae's c1 helps with energy and can reduce her q cost by up to 24, effectively making it cost 66 energy.
  Yae's c2 increases the scaling and ATK range on her E, which is quite good.
  Yae's c3 increases E by +3 which is good as well.
  Yae's c6 makes her E ignore 60% of DEF, which is good, but Raiden basically has this as her c2.
</p><p>
  Yae is fine at c0, but if one wants to be a dolphin, c2/c3 is a nice sweet spot.
  One can ask the question: should one whale for Yae's c6.
  If one really likes Yae, go for it.
  But in terms of money, note one can probably obtain Raiden's c2, which has the same effect, for the same cost or less.
</p>

<h2>Build</h2>
<p>Gilded 4p is Yae's bis for giving ATK and EM (which Yae converts to dmg bonus too).
  Because Yae's E is dynamic, the gilded effect can trigger off-field, buffing the ATK, EM (and dmg bonus) of her E.
  So Genshin seemed to plan with the future (Sumeru and dendro) in mind when designing Yae.
</p><p>
  Do ATK-Electro-Crit on the main stats and ATK, Crit, ER, EM on substats.
</p><p>
  Kagura's Verity is her bis weapon.
  The 2.5 event weapon is decent for giving ER.
  Yae generally wants ER to use her burst.
</p>


<h2>Teams</h2>
<p>
  She can be used on practically any team that needs a sub-dps.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Raikou team: Raiden-Yae-Kazuha-Bennett, Raiden-Yae-Sara-Jean, etc.</li>
<li>Nahida team: Nahida-Yae quicken, one of the most powerful sub-dps duos in the game,
  can literally be placed in almost any other team.
  One powerful example is Nahida-Raiden-Yae or Cyno-Nahida-Yae.
</li>
<li>Cyno team: Yae functions as an electro duo and sub-dps for Cyno.
  One possible structure is Cyno-Yae-dendro.
  Both Cyno and Yae can use gilded when proccing quicken.
</li>
<li>Taser: Childe-Yae-Raiden-Bennett, Sucrose-Yae-Beidou-Mona, etc.</li>
<li>Fireworks: Yoimiya-Yae</li>
<li>Superconduct: Eula-Yae (such a team will need a way to battery both Eula and Yae as the duo both have high energy costs).
  For example, Eula-Yae-Raiden-Diona or Eula-Yae-Raiden-Jean are viable.
</li>
<li>Xiao-Yae-Bennett, Itto-Yae, etc. where Yae provides off field dps</li>
<li>Diluc-Xingqiu-Yae: but in these cases, usually Bennett/Thoma/Venti/Kazuha are preferred in the other two slots.
  Hu Tao-Yae is cringe. You can use it, if you're bad at making teams and have poor judgment.
</li>
</ul>
<p>One could also try the "Yae national" consisting of Yae-Bennett-Xingqiu-Xiangling, but in this case, usually Raiden is preferred
  as she batteries the rest of the characters and can meet the energy requirement of the team more efficiently.
</p>

<h2>Raiden and Yae</h2>
<p>Both characters are Electro and from Inazuma. At Lv. 90, Yae has base ATK of 340, whereas Raiden has base ATK 337.
  In the story they are portrayed sort of like sisters or at least people who know each other well.
  So how do they compare?
  Generally speaking, Yae is a bit more consistent as a dps and better as a sub-dps / off field damage dealer,
  whereas Raiden is better as a battery and burst damage dealer.
  In terms of overall dps, Yae is more consistent as her E has 100% uptime,
  whereas Raiden has downtime on her Q,
  and Raiden still has to fill her Q and gain stacks to do an equivalent amount of damage.
  However, at C0, it is not even guaranteed that Raiden can always gain max stacks on her Q,
  even if she can spam it on cooldown.
  Still, a C3 Raiden becomes very competitive with a C3 Yae in terms of dps,
  and the fact that Raiden's C2 and Yae's C6 are similar shows this.
</p><p>
  In terms of AoE, Raiden has larger AoE. Yae's E skill is all single-target, though the AoE on Yae's Q is ok.
  Yae ascends with crit rate, which is nice.
  Raiden ascends with ER, but due to one of her passives that converts ER to dmg bonus,
  Raiden will usually always have higher dmg bonus unless one stacks EM on Yae (which is not usually recommended).
</p>

<h2>Calculations</h2>

<h3>C0</h3>
<p>We assume C0, level 10 E and Q.
  From testing, 1 sakura hits 5 times over its 14s duration.
  So 3 sakura can hit a total of 15 times.
  Suppose she has 2p TF and 2p WT (with around 100EM, which is achievable), 
  so the damage bonus is 46% goblet + 15% tf + 15% em = 76% for E.
  With level 3 sakura the dps is
  $$x_E = 170.64*1.76*15/14 \approx 321.78$$
</p><p>
  Now consider her burst dps.
  The scaling if all 3 sakura are detonated is 
  \(468+3*600.87=2270.61\).
  Then there is 46% goblet + 15% tf = 61% dmg bonus for q.
  The burst dps is
  $$x_Q = 2270.61*1.61/22= 166.17$$
  The total dps is
  $$x_E + x_Q = 487.95$$
  This is Raiden/Eula level, but a bit lower than Itto.
  It ignores any reaction damage.
  It only calculates damage from E and Q, assuming Yae is not autoattacking on field 
  (her AAs do not do as much as other characters).
  Most of Yae's dps comes from her E (like around 2/3 or 67%).
  Yae's main advantage is that she has 100% uptime on her E,
  whereas other characters may have downtime.
  Still most of this damage is quite single target, similar to Oz.
</p><p>
  Some people when calculating these figures for Yae ignore damage bonus and fool people in the media.
  You cannot do this. That is completely incorrect and blatantly wrong.
  Some characters like Xiao and Raiden simply get so much damage bonus 
  that they blow other characters out of the water in that department.
  Xiao's burst is literally a damage bonus buff of around 100%.
  Damage bonus is an integral part of these calculations that significantly affects theoretical dps.
</p>

<h3>C3</h3>
<p>At C3, the sakura can reach level 4. 
With level 13 E, the scaling for one sakura at level 4 is 251.81%.
The E dps increases by 
\(251.81/170.64 = 1.48 \)
times which is close to a 50% increase (similar to vaporize/melt).
By comparison Raiden's C2 is around a 40% increase.
The E dps becomes 
$$x_E = 474.8$$
The total dps becomes
$$x_E + x_Q = 641.0$$
So C3 Yae has lower dps than a C0 Xiao.
But C3 Yae has slightly higher dps than a C6 Beidou (when Beidou is against exactly 2 enemies).
Yae's main benefit is that she provides off-field sub-dps that can be added to other characters' dps.
For example, one can pair Xiao with Yae, Itto with Yae, Raiden with Yae, etc.
Yae functions similarly to Albedo.
</p>

<h3>C6</h3>
<p>At C6, her E will ignore 60% of DEF. Her E dps becomes
  $$x_E(C6) = x_E(C3)/(1-.6/2) = 678.3$$
  Interestingly this E dps is still lower than C0 Xiao's dps.
  We now consider her burst.
  At lv13 q detonating 3 sakura, the total scaling is
  \(552.5+3*709.36=2680.58\)
  The burst dps is
  $$x_Q(C6) = 2680.58*1.61/22= 196.17$$
  This is around a 20% increase in burst damage.
  The total dps is
  $$x_E + x_Q = 874.47$$
  This is slightly higher than C3 Raiden.
  Since Raiden does not really get any significant boosts to her own damage after C3,
  a C6 Yae can do as much dps (if not more) as a C6 Raiden.
</p>

<h3>Gilded and Dendro</h3>
<p>Assuming 4p gilded and 230 EM, her passive will give 34.5% dmg bonus (giving a total of 81.1% dmg bonus).
  At level 90, aggravate dmg increase will be
  $$b_a = 1663.56*1.8 \approx 2994.408$$
  or let's just round to 3000.
  If her attack is 2000 (achievable given her high base atk),
  the scaling on a level 3 sakura is 170.64,
  then the base damage is
  $$b = 2000*1.7064 + b_a = 6407.208$$
  In other words this is a 1.877 times increase in damage (compared to 2000*1.7064).
  This is almost like vaporizing a hit.
</p><p>
  Due to ICD, she will aggravate one of every three hits from the E.
  There are 15 hits, so there will be 5 aggravates.
  The dps is
  $$x_E = (170.64*(10+1.877*5))*1.811/14 \approx 427.9$$
  Before 3.0 and Gilded, it was 321.78.
  So Gilded gives a 1.33 times increase in damage.
  This is a pretty big increase in damage as far as artifact sets go (even bigger than the amazing VV buff).
  This cements the Gilded Dreams' position as one of the best sets in the game.
</p><p>
  Since the q has no icd it can proc aggravate on each hit.
  The total base damage is
  $$b = 2000*22.7061 + 4b_a = 57389.832$$
  The increase in base damage is 1.26 times.
  The increase in overall damage is 
  $$1.26*1.466/1.616 = 1.143$$
  So the burst dps is now
  $$x_Q = 166.17*1.143 = 189.9$$
  The total dps is then
  $$x = x_E + x_Q = 617.8$$
  So Gilded provides a huge increase in dps.
</p>

<h3>Factoring Bennett</h3>
<p>Sometimes Bennett may not be used in quicken teams as pyro can destroy the quicken status.
  So if other characters have Bennett and say 3k attack,
  then the above base damage b is a 1.252 times increase in damage (compared to 3000*1.7064).
  The dps is then
  $$x_E = (170.64*(10+1.252*5))*1.811/14 \approx 358.9$$
  This is still a 12% increase from before (321.78).
  So using quicken without Bennett actually does more damage than using Bennett without quicken.
</p><p>
  But why not both?
  If you are using Bennett with quicken (use Bennett q then apply quicken), then the base dmg is
  $$b = 3000*1.7064 + b_a = 8113.608$$
  which is a 1.585 times increase in damage.
  The dps is then
  $$x_E = (170.64*(10+1.585*5))*1.811/14 \approx 395.67$$
  This is a 1.23 times increase in damage from before (321.78).
  So this is still actually a bigger buff than deepwood.
  Just note that Bennett (and other atk buffs) and additive buffs like quicken compete with each other.
  If Bennett is not used on quicken teams (which is usually the case to preserve the quicken status),
  then the actual increase in damage is much greater (up to 33% as computed above).
</p><p>
  As for the q, the total base damage is
  $$b = 3000*22.7061 + 4b_a = 80118.3$$
  The increase in base damage is 1.176 times.
  The increase in overall damage is 
  $$1.176*1.466/1.616 = 1.0668$$
  So the burst dps is now
  $$x_Q = 166.17*1.0668 = 177.27$$
  The total dps is then
  $$x = x_E + x_Q = 572.94$$
