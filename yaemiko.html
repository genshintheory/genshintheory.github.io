    <title>Yae Miko</title>

<p><b>Yae Miko</b> (八重神子) owns a book store.
  She is the reason why many people skipped Ganyu and Zhongli.
  Yae is also a good upgrade from and replacement for Fischl.
</p>

<h2>Talents</h2>
<p>Yae is similar to Albedo in that she has 100% uptime on her E and provides off field damage.
  In this way, Yae is designed like a sub-dps.
  While, one can play her as an on field auto-attacking dps, 
  the scaling on her normal attacks are not the highest.
  Instead, it is usually recommended to focus more on investing into her E and Q,
  which together contribute the majority of her dps.
</p>

<h3>Elemental Skill</h3>
<p>
  Most of Yae's damage is from her E, which has 100% uptime and is off field.
  The range on Yae's E allows her to hit flying enemies like oceanid birds, specters, and eyes of storm
  (whereas Albedo's E may not always be able to).
  The only downside is that it is single target. Even the Electro samachurl totems do AoE pulses.
</p>

<h3>Elemental Burst</h3>
<p>
	The scaling on this is quite high.
  It has a 90 energy cost like Raiden's burst.
  Unlike Raiden's burst (17s cd), Yae's burst has a 22s cd.
  It is recommended to use a battery for Yae as her Q contributes a non-trivial amount to her overall dps.
  Raiden is one of her best teammates, especially as a battery, but if one does not have Raiden, Fischl is an ok budget option.
</p><p>
  Each lightning strike appears to apply 2b electro with no icd (or short enough icd)
  that electro is applied on each hit.
</p>

<h3>EM passive</h3>
<p>
  Yae has a passive that converts EM to dmg bonus on her E (.15% dmg bonus per EM point).
  This just makes EM a more useful substat on artifacts, but is still not recommended to stack EM on the weapon or as a main stat on artifacts.
  Having it as a substat suffices.
</p><p>
  Technically, if Yae gets 1000 EM (a tall order), she can get 150% dmg bonus.
  But usually one builds Yae as a normal dps (no EM as main stat on the artifact).
  And even if Yae gets 150% dmg bonus, Raiden can basically reach that level just with her ER conversion.
  Xiao is basically the only other character that can have higher total innate dmg bonus than Raiden at C0.
  Other than that, Mona (with her omen buff) and a C6 Kazuha can also reach a similar level of dmg bonus. 
  C6 Kazuha gets .2% dmg bonus per EM point, but that is at C6 only (and for 5s at a time).
</p>

<h2>Constellations</h2>
<p>
  Yae's c1 helps with energy and can reduce her q cost by up to 24, effectively making it cost 66 energy.
  Yae's c2 increases the scaling and ATK range on her E, which is quite good.
  Yae's c3 increases E by +3 which is good as well.
  Yae's c6 makes her E ignore 60% of DEF, which is good, but Raiden basically has this as her c2.
</p><p>
  Yae is fine at c0, but if one wants to be a dolphin, c2/c3 is a nice sweet spot.
  One can ask the question: should one whale for Yae's c6.
  If one really likes Yae, go for it.
  But in terms of money, note one can probably obtain Raiden's c2, which has the same effect, for the same cost or less.
</p>

<h2>Teams</h2>
<p>
  She can be used on practically any team that needs a sub-dps.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Raikou team: Raiden-Yae-Kazuha-Bennett, Raiden-Yae-Sara-Jean, etc.</li>
<li>Taser: Childe-Yae-Raiden-Bennett, Sucrose-Yae-Beidou-Mona, etc.</li>
<li>Fireworks: Yoimiya-Yae</li>
<li>Superconduct: Eula-Yae (such a team will need a way to battery both Eula and Yae as the duo both have high energy costs).
  For example, Eula-Yae-Raiden-Diona or Eula-Yae-Raiden-Jean are viable.
</li>
<li>Xiao-Yae-Bennett, Itto-Yae, etc. where Yae provides off field dps</li>
<li>Hu Tao-Xingqiu-Yae, Diluc-Xingqiu-Yae: but in these cases, usually Bennett/Thoma/Venti/Kazuha are preferred in the other two slots.</li>
</ul>
<p>One could also try the "Yae national" consisting of Yae-Bennett-Xingqiu-Xiangling, but in this case, usually Raiden is preferred
  as she batteries the rest of the characters and can meet the energy requirement of the team more efficiently.
</p>

<h2>Raiden and Yae</h2>
<p>Both characters are Electro and from Inazuma. At Lv. 90, Yae has base ATK of 340, whereas Raiden has base ATK 337.
  In the story they are portrayed sort of like sisters or at least people who know each other well.
  So how do they compare?
  Generally speaking, Yae is a bit more consistent as a dps and better as a sub-dps / off field damage dealer,
  whereas Raiden is better as a battery and burst damage dealer.
  In terms of overall dps, Yae is more consistent as her E has 100% uptime,
  whereas Raiden has downtime on her Q,
  and Raiden still has to fill her Q and gain stacks to do an equivalent amount of damage.
  However, at C0, it is not even guaranteed that Raiden can always gain max stacks on her Q,
  even if she can spam it on cooldown.
  Still, a C3 Raiden becomes very competitive with a C3 Yae in terms of dps,
  and the fact that Raiden's C2 and Yae's C6 are similar shows this.
</p><p>
  In terms of AoE, Raiden has larger AoE. Yae's E skill is all single-target, though the AoE on Yae's Q is ok.
  Yae ascends with crit rate, which is nice.
  Raiden ascends with ER, but due to one of her passives that converts ER to dmg bonus,
  Raiden will usually always have higher dmg bonus unless one stacks EM on Yae (which is not usually recommended).
