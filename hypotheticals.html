  <h2>What if Scaramouche were Electro?</h2>
  <p>For the first 2 years of Genshin, Scaramouche was thought to be electro.
    His change to an anemo unit that can fly around was a sudden surprise 
    (perhaps serendipity as it greatly increases his usefulness in exploration).
  </p><p>
    But what if Scaramouche were an electro catalyst instead of anemo?
    Perhaps the ability to fly resonates better with anemo,
    but suppose all aspects of Scaramouche's kit remain the same, except all his attacks are now electro.
  </p><p>
    As an electro catalyst, he would be competing with Yae and Lisa.
    As an electro dps, he would be competing with Raiden, Yae, etc.
    Maybe being electro makes sense lore-wise given that Scaramouche refers to Raiden as his 'mother'.
    But being an electro catalyst would perhaps make Scaramouche less unique.
    As of version 3, the only other anemo catalyst is Sucrose.
  </p><p>
    But being electro does allow him to do quicken and hyperbloom more readily.
    Technically, anemo Scaramouche can proc quicken and hyperbloom by swirling electro in an anemo dendro taser team.
    But an electro Scaramouche can directly aggravate or hyperbloom without having to swirl electro.
  </p><p>
    For aggravate, switching Scaramouche to electro would not increase his dps by much given his NA/CA have high scalings
    (so the additive bonus from quicken hits diminishing returns).
    In this case it would make sense to break the scaling into smaller parts, so that he can proc aggravate more often.
    It would also make sense to change the E buff from a damage multiplier to dmg bonus.
    And to complete the kit, giving him some EM scaling or EM buff would make him more suitable for quicken/hyperbloom
    (similar to how Yae gets EM scaling on her E).
  </p><p>
    Interestingly, an electro Scaramouche would benefit from C6 too 
    as it gives an extra instance of damage to NA, which allows for more aggravates.
  </p>
  <p>An electro Scaramouche would probably work best in quickbloom teams and work well with the usual suspects (Nahida, Yelan, etc.).
    Being electro instead of anemo, he may no longer fit as neatly in some reaction teams (such as freeze), 
    but the change to electro may not affect his teams too much.
    He could work as a hyperbloom driver that applies electro very fast to proc many hyperbloom reactions.
    His selling point would be that he has to proc hyperblooms faster than Raiden (E hits every .9s), Kuki (C4), Yae, and other electro units.
    An electro Scaramouche would also probably powercreep keqing as a quickswap electro dps (E dps, not Q dps).
  </p><p>
    But an electro Scaramouche would put him in more direct competition with another electro dps that applies electro fast: Cyno.
    Cyno's electro app is quite fast, he has natural EM buffs and scalings, and he can also drive quickbloom while having high scalings.
    So it would almost be redundant to have both an electro Scaramouche and electro Cyno 
    (not that Genshin is opposed to redundancy: e.g. Yelan/XQ).
    But a follow-up question to this is: what if Cyno were not electro?
  </p>


  <h2>What if Cyno were a different element?</h2>
  <p>First, Cyno was probably a polearm user since day 1 given the appearance in the travail trailer.
    And given his outfit is purple, electro does make some sense for him.
    In Genshin, the color palette of a character's outfit usually matches their element, with not too many exceptions.
    Even Scaramouche's outfit color was changed to adapt to the anemo element.
  </p><p>
    Nonetheless, there used to be speculations that Cyno was a different element,
    perhaps most interestingly dendro.
    Suppose Cyno was a dendro polearm and kept all other aspects of his kit.
    Then for spread, dendro Cyno would want an electro partner.
    He would then actually work well with Raiden.
    He would still work well with Yae and Kuki.
    And perhaps for pure spread teams, Cyno may be able to do a bit more dps (given spread has a higher RC than aggravate for same EM).
  </p><p>
    However, his role would change for bloom/hyperbloom teams.
    Instead of being the one proccing hyperbloom,
    a dendro Cyno would be creating lots of dendro cores,
    enabling an off-field electro unit such as full EM Raiden, Kuki, or Yae to proc hyperbloom.
    In this case, a dendro Cyno would be very similar to Childe as an on-field reaction enabler.
  </p><p>
    While the idea of a dendro Xiao proccing quickbloom and doing green dustbolt nukes sounds cool,
    a follow-up question would be: but then wouldn't a dendro Cyno overlap with Alhaitham?
    Both a dendro Cyno and Alhaitham would fulfill a similar role, as a dendro dps/reaction enabler, applying dendro really fast.
