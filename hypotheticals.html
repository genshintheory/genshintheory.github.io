  <h2>What if Scaramouche were Electro?</h2>
  <p>For the first 2 years of Genshin, Scaramouche was thought to be electro.
    His change to an anemo unit that can fly around was a sudden surprise 
    (perhaps serendipity as it greatly increases his usefulness in exploration).
  </p><p>
    But what if Scaramouche were an electro catalyst instead of anemo?
    Perhaps the ability to fly resonates better with anemo,
    but suppose all aspects of Scaramouche's kit remain the same, except all his attacks are now electro.
  </p><p>
    As an electro catalyst, he would be competing with Yae and Lisa.
    As an electro dps, he would be competing with Raiden, Yae, etc.
    Maybe being electro makes sense lore-wise given that Scaramouche refers to Raiden as his 'mother'.
    But being an electro catalyst would perhaps make Scaramouche less unique.
    As of version 3, the only other anemo catalyst is Sucrose.
  </p><p>
    But being electro does allow him to do quicken and hyperbloom more readily.
    Technically, anemo Scaramouche can proc quicken and hyperbloom by swirling electro in an anemo dendro taser team.
    But an electro Scaramouche can directly aggravate or hyperbloom without having to swirl electro.
  </p><p>
    For aggravate, switching Scaramouche to electro would not increase his dps by much given his NA/CA have high scalings
    (so the additive bonus from quicken hits diminishing returns).
    In this case it would make sense to break the scaling into smaller parts, so that he can proc aggravate more often.
    It would also make sense to change the E buff from a damage multiplier to dmg bonus.
    And to complete the kit, giving him some EM scaling or EM buff would make him more suitable for quicken/hyperbloom
    (similar to how Yae gets EM scaling on her E).
  </p><p>
    Interestingly, an electro Scaramouche would benefit from C6 too 
    as it gives an extra instance of damage to NA, which allows for more aggravates.
  </p>
  <p>An electro Scaramouche would probably work best in quickbloom teams.
    He could work as a hyperbloom driver that applies electro very fast to proc many hyperbloom reactions.
    His selling point would be that he has to proc hyperblooms faster than Raiden (E hits every .9s), Kuki (C4), Yae, and other electro units.
