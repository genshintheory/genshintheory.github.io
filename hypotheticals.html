  <h2>What is Scaramouche were Electro?</h2>
  <p>For the first 2 years of Genshin, Scaramouche was thought to be electro.
    His change to an anemo unit that can fly around was a sudden surprise 
    (perhaps serendipity as it greatly increases his usefulness in exploration).
  </p><p>
    But what if Scaramouche were an electro catalyst instead of anemo?
    Perhaps the ability to fly resonates better with anemo,
    but suppose all aspects of Scaramouche's kit remain the same, except all his attacks are now electro.
  </p><p>
    As an electro catalyst, he would be competing with Yae and Lisa.
    As an electro dps, he would be competing with Raiden, Yae, etc.
    Maybe being electro makes sense lore-wise given that Scaramouche refers to Raiden as his 'mother'.
