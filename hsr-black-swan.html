  <p>Black Swan (黑天鹅 Hei Tian'e) is a thriller film directed by Darren Aronofsky based on Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake.

  <h2>Kit</h2>
  <p>She does dot, shreds def, and has aoe. This already makes her a very strong character.
    In Genshin, there are not many characters that can shred def and deal a lot of aoe damage at C0.
  </p>
  <p>Her BA has a 65% chance (lv6) of inflicting Arcana on the enemy.
    If the enemy is inflicted with a dot (wind shear, shock, burn, bleed),
    each dot also has 65% chance of inflicting 1 extra Arcana stack.
    So suppose an enemy has the max possible of 4 dots 
    (not sure how possible this is, would need something like Kafka/Serval, Luka, Guinaifen or a full diversity team).
    The average number of Arcana stacks from BA would be
    \(4*.65 = 2.6\).
  </p><p>
    Her E does a blast and has 100% chance of inflicting Arcana on the enemies.
    It also has 100% chance of shredding their def by around 20% at lv10 (for 3 turns).
  </p>

  <p>So what on earth is Arcana?
    Arcana basically acts like an enhanced wind dot.
    Additional stacks on Arcana make it do much more damage (like literal nukes per turn).
    Moreover, Arcana can spread like a contagion to adjacent targets and even ignore def when there are enough stacks.
    This spreading property combined with high scaling and def ignore make Arcana pretty broken if we may use a moderate and sober term.
    This dynamical spreading effect (deterministic) is reminiscent of Arataki Itto's C6 (which is probabilistic/stochastic).
    Actually, technically the spreading effect may still be a bit random 
    as it could depend on the chance (effect hit rate) that Swan and other characters apply dot.
