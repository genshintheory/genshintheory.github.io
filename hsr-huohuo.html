  <p>Huohuo (藿藿) is a wind abundance healer.
    Given that Huohuo and Hanya released in 1.5,
    one is reminded by the history of the Han dynasty.
  </p><p>
    During the reign of Liu Che, the Han dynasty fought a war against and defeated the Hun (匈奴) nomads in the north Eurasian steppe
    in campaigns such as the Battle of Mobei.
    One such Han dynasty soldier who helped defeat the Huns went by the name Huo Qubing (霍去病).
  </p><p>
    We have talked a lot about how Scaramouche in some aspect embodies the legacy of Liu Che,
    a powerful emperor who also slayed many in the wars in the steppe.
    And following similar lines, perhaps Huohuo can be thought of as an embodiment of the warrior Huo Qubing from the same era.
  </p><p>
    We tend to give a very heroic and clean portrayal of Liu Che,
    but people who study the history of war will know how bloody large-scale conquests can be,
    and the Han-Hun war is no exception.
  </p><p>
    To put some food for thought:
    we invite people to discover how many casualties there were in the Han-Hun wars.
    We will also let people think about whether the Huns exist anymore in China
    and then connect that to the conquests made during Liu Che's reign.
    Why is this a big deal? 
    The reason is because the Tang dynasty (like the Han dynasty) also conquered a nomadic empire 
    called the Gokturks who inhabited the same stretch of land as the Huns.
    The difference between the Han and Tang is that the Turks still exist to this day.
  </p><p>
    Perhaps at a later time we will be more explicit about what we mean when we talk about the Fatui Harbingers as a whole.
    But we already discussed how Tartaglia corresponds to the Tatar people of the steppe,
    and history has shown that there has been large-scale bloodshed that accompanied the Tatar conquests of Eurasia.

  <h2>Kit</h2>
  <p>Her E does blast healing (not aoe like baizhu, but heals adjacent targets for less) and debuffs.
    Her Q restores around 20% max energy for all allies (except self) and buffs atk up to around 40%.
  </p><p>
    Her basic atk deals dmg scaling off her hp.
    After using E, she gains a divine provision effect for 2 turns.
    While the effect is active, an ally will be healed when their turn starts or when they use Q.
    Moreover when that ally is healed, all other allies with <50% hp will be healed. 
    This healing from divine provision can debuff up to 6 times (or be reset upon E).
  </p>


  <h2>Genshin equivalent</h2>
  <p>Such a healer could synergize with Focalors as she can heal allies back up to 50+% hp.
    Suppose she is an anemo healer.
  </p><p>
    How do we define blast healing (or even ST healing) in Genshin?
    Thinking about the sourcewater droplets of the hydro MC (and Noctis),
    perhaps a ST healer could create a crystal.
    When a character picks up that crystal they are healed.
  </p><p>
    For blast healing, the crystal can heal 'adjacent' party members as well.
    This 'adjacent' condition could suggest putting destruction characters (or characters who take a lot of damage) in the middle of the party.
    But this seems a bit contrived and unnatural.
    In Genshin, we can simply just have the E do a partywide heal (like baizhu).
    Or it can be like Barbara or Kuki's ring and heal the on-field character.
  </p><p>
    Then the passive is that for say 10s after using E,
    the active character will be healed once per 2s,
    and all party members with <50% will be healed too every 2s.
  </p><p>
    Her Q can then restore energy for the team (like what Raiden does)
    while also buffing atk (like Noblesse set).
  </p><p>
    Another passive can restore energy to her each time allies are healed.
