  <p>Huohuo (藿藿) is a wind abundance healer.
    Given that Huohuo and Hanya released in 1.5,
    one is reminded by the history of the Han dynasty.
  </p><p>
    During the reign of Liu Che, the Han dynasty fought a war against and defeated the Hun (匈奴) nomads in the north Eurasian steppe
    in campaigns such as the Battle of Mobei.
    One such Han dynasty soldier who helped defeat the Huns went by the name Huo Qubing (霍去病).
  </p><p>
    We have talked a lot about how Scaramouche in some aspect embodies the legacy of Liu Che,
    a powerful emperor who also slayed many in the wars in the steppe.
    We tend to give a very heroic and clean portrayal of Liu Che,
    but people who study the history of war will know how bloody large-scale conquests can be,
    and the Han-Hun war is no exception.
