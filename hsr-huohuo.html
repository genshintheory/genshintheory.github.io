  <p>Huohuo (藿藿) is a wind abundance healer.
    Given that Huohuo and Hanya released in 1.5,
    one is reminded by the history of the Han dynasty.
  </p><p>
    During the reign of Liu Che, the Han dynasty fought a war against and defeated the Hun (匈奴) nomads in the north Eurasian steppe
    in campaigns such as the Battle of Mobei.
    One such Han dynasty soldier who helped defeat the Huns went by the name Huo Qubing (霍去病).
    This is perhaps 'common knowledge' to anyone aware of Chinese history.
