  <p>Huohuo (藿藿) is a wind abundance healer.
    Given that Huohuo and Hanya released in 1.5,
    one is reminded by the history of the Han dynasty.
  </p><p>
    During the reign of Liu Che, the Han dynasty fought a war against and defeated the Hun (匈奴) nomads in the north Eurasian steppe
    in campaigns such as the Battle of Mobei.
    One such Han dynasty soldier who helped defeat the Huns went by the name Huo Qubing (霍去病).
  </p><p>
    We have talked a lot about how Scaramouche in some aspect embodies the legacy of Liu Che,
    a powerful emperor who also slayed many in the wars in the steppe.
    And following similar lines, perhaps Huohuo can be thought of as an embodiment of the warrior Huo Qubing from the same era.
  </p><p>
    We tend to give a very heroic and clean portrayal of Liu Che,
    but people who study the history of war will know how bloody large-scale conquests can be,
    and the Han-Hun war is no exception.
  </p><p>
    To put some food for thought:
    we invite people to discover how many casualties there were in the Han-Hun wars.
    We will also let people think about whether the Huns exist anymore in China
    and then connect that to the conquests made during Liu Che's reign.
    Why is this a big deal? 
    The reason is because the Tang dynasty (like the Han dynasty) also conquered a nomadic empire 
    called the Gokturks who inhabited the same stretch of land as the Huns.
    The difference between the Han and Tang is that the Turks still exist to this day.
  </p><p>
    Perhaps at a later time we will be more explicit about what we mean when we talk about the Fatui Harbingers as a whole.
    But we already discussed how Tartaglia corresponds to the Tatar people of the steppe,
    and history has shown that there has been large-scale bloodshed that accompanied the Tatar conquests of Eurasia.

  <h2>Huohuo in Genshin</h2>
  <p>Her E does blast healing (not aoe like baizhu, but heals adjacent targets for less).
    Her Q restores around 20% max energy for all allies (except self) and buffs atk up to around 40%.
