    <p>Barbara is a better hydro healer than kokomi.
      Her E healing has longer duration at 15s.
      With her passive this can increase to 20s (if the party obtains energy particles).
      With her C2 her cd is reduced by 15% from 32s to 27.2s,
      giving her a 7.2s downtime (compared to kokomi's 8s downtime).
    </p><p>
      Her Q heals the whole party, without having to stay on-field and NA as with kokomi.
      And her C6 can revive fallen party members, something kokomi can never do.
      To give an idea on how much her Q can heal, at lv13 it regenerates 37.4% HP + 4659.69.
      If Barbara has 30k hp (easy to achieve as she ascends with hp too),
      then this is a 15879.69 hp party-wide heal.
      Most characters at lv90 will have around 15k-20k hp if they are not hp-scaling,
      so Barbara's burst basically heals all their hp.
    </p><p>
      With C1 she regenerates 1 energy every 10s.
      So by doing nothing, it would take 800s (~13 minutes) to get her burst up from 0.
      Another passive reduces stamina consumption by 12% with her E
      (perhaps this matters for hu tao, since most other dps that are actually meta like Itto, Scaramouche do not need stamina for CA).
    </p>

    <p>
      Weapons that can be used are the TTDS, prototype amber, ER catalysts, hp catalysts.
      Apparently dps Barbara is a thing, so perhaps dps catalysts like widsith, kagura can work.
      Artifacts include the 4p ocean clam set or 4p maiden's.
      2p tenacity, 2p dehya set can also work.
    </p>

    <p>Her C2 also gives 15% hydro dmg bonus so she can be paired with hydro dps like Childe, Yelan, etc.
      With TTDS she can support many on-field hypercarries such as Xiao, Itto, Cyno, Scaramouche, etc.
      that have longer dps windows.
      Her other main use is in hyperbloom teams.
