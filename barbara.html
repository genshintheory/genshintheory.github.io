    <p>Barbara is a better hydro healer than kokomi.
      Her E healing has longer duration at 15s.
      With her passive this can increase to 20s (if the party obtains energy particles).
      With her C2 her cd is reduced by 15% from 32s to 27.2s,
      giving her a 7.2s downtime (compared to kokomi's 8s downtime).
    </p><p>
      Her Q heals the whole party, without having to stay on-field and NA as with kokomi.
      And her C6 can revive fallen party members, something kokomi can never do.
    </p>

    <p>Her C2 also gives 15% hydro dmg so she can be paired with hydro dps like Childe, Yelan, etc.
    </p><p>
      Weapons that can be used are the TTDS, prototype amber, ER catalysts, hp catalysts.
      Apparently dps Barbara is a thing, so perhaps dps catalysts like widsith, kagura can work.
