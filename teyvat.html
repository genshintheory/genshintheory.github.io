  <p>Teyvat is the fictional continent of Genshin Impact and is home to seven nations.
    It is generally believed that these nations correspond to certain nations or civilizations in real life.
    For example, most people believe that Inazuma is a fictional representation of Japan,
    whether through the culture, language, etc.
    Inazuma is probably the most obvious example.
  </p><p>
    But other than that, what do the other nations represent?
    Is it as obvious?
  </p>

  <h2>Mondstadt and Liyue</h2>
  <p>
    Let's start with the first two nations on the traveler's journey: Mondstadt and Liyue.
    Mondstadt has its own interesting story that will be discussed later.
    So let's talk about Liyue first.
    Many people believe Liyue represents some form of China
    given the culture, language, and names of the characters and places.
    But China itself is a very large concept with a very long history.
    Does the Liyue of Genshin Impact represent all of China and its entire history?
    It cannot be so simple.
  </p><p>
    First look at China's geography.
    Liyue captures the mountainous regions and marshy swamps of Southern China quite well
    (through Guili plains, etc.).
    But what about the vast steppe plains of China's north?
    What about the vast deserts such as the Gobi?
    These are entirely absent in Liyue.
  </p><p>
    So for a vast concept such as China, Liyue only seems to represent a part of it,
    namely the part of China south of the Great Wall.
    So who represents the other part of China, namely the part of China north and northeast of the Great Wall?
  </p><p>
    This goes into our second question? What does Mondstadt represent?
    Mondstadt is located northeast of Liyue.
    Many people believe that it represents German or some form of European culture.
    And that may not be wrong at all.
    But what if Mondstadt represented something more than Germany?
  </p><p>
    Germany is situated in the western part of the Eurasian continent.
    Why would Genshin choose to put it northeast of Liyue, nevermind border Liyue at all?
    First look at Mondstadt's name in Chinese 蒙德 Mengde.
    Literally, 蒙 Meng means Mongol and 德 De represents Germany (Deutschland).
    At first, some people may think these characters were chosen to transliterate the word 'Mond' meaning moon in German.
    They are not entirely wrong at all.
    But as is the case with many things in Genshin, some things have multiple meanings.
    Mengde or Mongol Germany just so happens to represent something else deeply tied to the history of China as well:
  </p><p>
    The Mongol Empire, also known in Chinese as the Yuan dynasty (元朝).
  </p><p>
    What do the Mongols and Germans have anything to do with each other?
    The Mongol armies reached as far as Germany during the Mongol Empire.
    So Mongol Germany basically represents how wide the Mongol Empire was at its peak.
    It reached as far west as Germany and as far east as China.
  </p><p>
    And that brings us back to the question: who represents the northern part of China,
    the part north of the Great Wall?
    These are precisely the Mongols and various other groups that inhabit north China.
    It should no longer come as much of a surprise to see why Mondstadt is located north of Liyue.
  </p><p>
    China is a large civilizational concept with a long history.
    Certainly, during the smaller Song or Ming dynasties, Liyue may be an accurate representation of the land south of the Great Wall.
    But that does not represent all of China.
    China has also gone through various other historical phases,
    such as the Yuan and Qing dynasties,
    when the emperors were from the north and northeast.
  </p><p>
    The Mongols and Man people are precisely those that hailed from north of the Great Wall.
    It just so happens that the game itself is named 原神 or Yuanshen.
    Moreover, the Qing dynasty lasted just as long as the Ming dynasty (around 200-300 years)
    and had just as important of an influence as (if not greater influence than) the Ming on modern China.
    These were also Chinese dynasties.
    And it is quite naive to assume that the small nation of Liyue can represent a gigantic concept such as China.
    Liyue may represent south China, definitely a very important part of China and the source of much of modern Chinese culture, 
    but considering China's history in the past millennia, 
    it is not much of a stretch to say that Mondstadt represents another side of China.
  </p>

  <h2>Anemo and Geo</h2>
  <p>Mondstadt represents Anemo, whereas Liyue represents Geo.
    Anemo represents the wind, an amorphous concept that can swirl and cover large AoE, 
    while also being able to absorb elements and take on other forms.
    Geo represents the sturdy and defensive, the rocky and shielded.
    How do these elements further emphasize the traits of their respective nations?
  </p><p>
    There is a stereotype that much of China's history has been defensive in nature.
    During the weaker and smaller periods of the Song and Ming, this is true.
    Southern China was fighting the northerners.
    They built the large Great Wall from rock and earth to defend themselves.
    For these periods in history, the shield and Geo element represent 'China' (or the southern part) quite well.
  </p><p>
    But that is a naive and incomplete assessment of Chinese history.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anemo represents the northern element that has expanded across wide territory,
    having large AoE, while absorbing other elements, eventually becoming them.
    It is a kind of metaphor for the nomads of north, who have traveled across vast swaths of territory,
    over time settling down and becoming part of myriad civilizations.
    This is the manifestation of what the Yuan and Qing dynasties have accomplished in history.
  </p><p>
    Geo represents a crystallization of culture and civilization into something solid that lasts throughout the ages.
    Regardless of whatever winds are howling, the earth remains firm.
    This is a representation of the continuation of Chinese culture throughout its various historical periods.
    Regardless of time or space, a certain constant, that core civilizational identity has remained throughout millennia.
  </p><p>
    It should be emphasized that both the Anemo and Geo element are important in Chinese history.
    If the Yuan and Qing are the extreme embodiments of the Anemo during its golden ages,
    then the Han and Tang dynasties are the embodiments of Geo during its golden ages.
    Both the Han and Tang easily count as two of China's greatest empires in history.
    Both successfully conquered the north, whereas the Song and Ming completely failed to do so.
    Even though the Han and Tang are a representation of the Geo core civilizational culture,
    neither were completely passive nor defensive in nature.
    The Han and Tang were offensive in nature and turned that Geo element into dps.
    It is sort of like what the Geo claymore user Itto does, converting defense into attack.
  </p><p>
    An empire long divided must unite.
    During the periods in history when north and south were unified,
    when Anemo and Geo were one,
    the Great Wall became merely a tourist attraction.
    There was no need for war and bloodshed, when everybody lived under one roof of heaven.
    This kind of large-scale unity of the empire basically only happened four times in China's history in the past 2000 years:
    during the Han, Tang, Yuan, and Qing.
  </p>

  <h2>Anemo and Inazuma</h2>
  <p>With the arrival of Inazuma, it has been noted that the enemies are heavier and not easily pulled and lifted
    by vacuum abilities such as Venti's burst.
    For example, the nobushi samurai with heavy armor are hard to lift with Venti's abilities.
    Is this a coincidence?
  </p><p>
    Historically, the Mongol Empire was extremely successful, conquering territories almost everywhere across Eurasia.
    But one of the lands it was unable to conquer was Japan.
    It is said that the Mongol armies were washed away in a typhoon when trying to invade Japan.
    Now if Venti is the archon of Mondstadt,
    is it much of a surprise that the enemies of Japan are not so easily lifted by his abilities?
  </p><p>
    Of course, there is the other argument.
    Venti was simply too broken before 2.0. 
    Heavier enemies in Inazuma were introduced to make him more balanced.
    It is certainly plausible.
    But yet again many things in Genshin have layers of meanings.
  </p>

  <h2>Kazuha</h2>
  <p>So if Inazuman enemies are harder to lift by Venti's abilities,
    where does Kazuha, the anemo ronin, fit in Inazuma?
    First off, Kazuha himself is an outcast who escaped the vision hunt decree of the Raiden Shogun.
    Kazuha's friend was even slain by the Shogun herself.
    So Kazuha, while being part of Inazuma, is also a character somewhat outside of Inazuma.
    He finds refuge in Beidou's ship.
    And at least historically or symbolically, the Beidou-Kazuha duo promoted by Genshin
    can be seen as homage to the cultural ties between ancient China and Japan,
    or specifically the influence of the Tang dynasty on ancient Japan.
    After all, the Japanese script and much of the shared culture has its origins during the Tang period.
    And as an added bonus (for those who care about seiyuu culture), Beidou's Chinese voice actor is Tang Yajing,
    and Beidou herself weilds the Electro element emblematic of Inazuma.
  </p>


  <h2>Tartaglia</h2>
  <p>Similar to Kazuha, Tartaglia (Childe) is another character that appears closely tied to Liyue,
    but is also somewhat a force 'outside' of Liyue.
    Tartaglia does represent something deeply tied to China's history.
    This goes back to the Mongol empire and the 'Tatar' people or so-called 'Tatar-Mongol yoke'.
  </p><p>
    The term 'Tatar' has also been used historically to refer to the various people living around China's north,
    including the Mongol and Man people.
    So the term Tatar is tied to the Yuan and Qing periods.
    The stereotype of northeners is that they are tall, big, and good at fighting,
    and this is sort of captured by Tartaglia's character and story.
  </p><p>
    How did the Mongol empire, the Yuan dynasty, rise?
    What existed before the Mongol empire?
    During the period 900-1200, most of the world was divided into many small kingdoms,
    akin to small chunks or mobs almost.
    Even China itself was divided into several smaller kingdoms,
    including the Song, Jin, Liao, Xia, etc.
    Outside of China, the world was divided as well, 
    whether it was in Central Asia, West Asia, North Eurasia, Europe, etc.
  </p><p>
    When these kingdoms were divided, naturally many conflicts and wars arised between them.
    Like a multi-body problem, the dynamics were complex.
    Essentially, what the Mongol Yuan accomplished
    was taking advantage of the various conflicts between these many different kingdoms,
    ultimately unifying them all into a single massive empire.
    Often if two kingdoms were fighting, they may use one kingdom against the other,
    and in the end take over both.
    This is exactly what happened with the Song, Jin, and Xia dynasties.
    Song, Jin, Xia were all fighting each other.
    The Yuan would ally with the Song to take over the Jin,
    and after that the Yuan would take over the Song.
  </p><p>
    Using one element against another is essentially what Anemo swirl does.
    It spreads elemental statuses across an AoE,
    making Anemo the premier element in breaking shields when multiple enemies are present.
  </p><p>
    But there is another ability in the game based on the same concept: Riptide.
    When multiple enemies are marked with riptide and are close to each other,
    the riptide will hit each other and do many instances of damage.
    This is arguably the most op skill in Childe's arsenal.
  </p>

  <h2>Elements</h2>
  <p>
    Why was Electro chosen as the element for Inazuma?
    One reason that comes to mind is Japan's relatively advanced electric technology and industries.
