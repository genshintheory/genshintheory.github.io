  <p>Teyvat is the fictional continent of Genshin Impact and is home to seven nations.
    It is generally believed that these nations correspond to certain nations or civilizations in real life.
    For example, most people believe that Inazuma is a fictional representation of Japan,
    whether through the culture, language, etc.
    Inazuma is probably the most obvious example.
  </p><p>
    But other than that, what do the other nations represent?
    Is it as obvious?
  </p>

  <h2>Mondstadt and Liyue</h2>
  <p>
    Let's start with the first two nations on the traveler's journey: Mondstadt and Liyue.
    Mondstadt has its own interesting story that will be discussed later.
    So let's talk about Liyue first.
    Many people belive Liyue represents some form of China
    given the culture, language, and names of the characters and places.
    But China itself is a very large concept with a very long history.
    Does the Liyue of Genshin Impact represent all of China and its entire history?
    It cannot be so simple.
  </p><p>
    First look at China's geography.
    Liyue captures the mountainous regions and marshy swamps of Southern China quite well
    (through Guili plains, etc.).
    But what about the vast steppe plains of China's north?
    What about the vast deserts such as the Gobi?
    These are entirely absent in Liyue.
  </p><p>
    So for a vast concept such as China, Liyue only seems to represent a part of it,
    namely the part of China south of the Great Wall.
    So who represents the other part of China, namely the part of China north and northeast of the Great Wall?
  </p><p>
    This goes into our second question? What does Mondstadt represent?
    Mondstadt is located northeast of Liyue.
    Many people believe that it represents German or some form of European culture.
    And that may not be wrong at all.
    But what if Mondstadt represented something more than Germany?
  </p><p>
    Germany is situated in the western part of the Eurasian continent.
    Why would Genshin choose to put it northeast of Liyue, nevermind border Liyue at all?
    First look at Mondstadt's name in Chinese 蒙德 Mengde.
    Literally, 蒙 Meng means Mongol and 德 De represents Germany (Deutschland).
    At first, some people may think these characters were chosen to transliterate the word 'Mond' meaning moon in German.
    They are not entirely wrong at all.
    But as is the case with many things in Genshin, some things have multiple meanings.
    Mengde or Mongol Germany just so happens to represent something else deeply tied to the history of China as well.
  </p><p>
    The Mongol Empire, also known in Chinese as the Yuan dynasty (元朝).
  </p><p>
    What do the Mongols and Germans have anything to do with each other?
    The Mongol armies reached as far as Germany during the Mongol Empire.
    So Mongol Germany basically represents how wide the Mongol Empire was at its peak.
    It reached as far west as Germany and as far east as China.
  </p><p>
    And that brings us back to the question: who represents the northern part of China,
    the part north of the Great Wall?
    These are precisely the Mongols and various other groups that inhabit north China.
    It should no longer come as much of a surprise to see why Mondstadt is located north of Liyue.
  </p><p>
    China is a large civilizational concept with a long history.
    Certainly, during the Song or Ming dynasties, Liyue may be an accurate representation of the land south of the Great Wall.
    But that does not represent all of China.
    China has also gone through various other historical phases,
    such as the Yuan and Qing dynasties,
    when the emperors were from the north and northeast.
    The Mongols and Man people are precisely those that hailed from north of the Great Wall.
    It just so happens that the game itself is named 原神 or Yuanshen.
    Moreover, the Qing dynasty lasted just as long as the Ming dynasty (around 200-300 years)
    and had just as important of an influence (if not greater influence) than the Ming on modern China.
    These were also Chinese dynasties.
    And it is quite naive to assume that the small nation of Liyue can represent a gigantic concept such as China.
    Liyue may represent south China, definitely a very important part of China and the source of much of modern Chinese culture, 
    but considering China's history in the past millennia, 
    it is not much of a stretch to say that Mondstadt represents another side of China.
