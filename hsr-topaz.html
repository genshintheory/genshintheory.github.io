  <p>Topaz is a fire ST damage dealer.
    The way she works is almost similar to Albedo.
    Rather than being a 'hypercarry' or 'dps' (like Seele),
    Topaz is more of a subdps who can deal coordinated damage (via her trotter Numby) alongside your main dps.
    So rather than using her as the sole dps on the team, she can be paired with your dps and deal 'off-field' damage like Albedo.
  </p><p>
    So Topaz falls into a class of units that could be called 'sub-dps' in Genshin.
    Besides Albedo, some other <a href='subdps.html'>subdps</a> (via E) in Genshin include 
    Nahida, Dehya, Yae, Fischl, even Kuki and Raiden (for hyperbloom).
    There are also subdps via Q such as Beidou, XQ, Yelan,
    but here Topaz is more of a subdps via E (skill).
  </p><p>
    Some of the best characters/supports in Genshin are subdps (e.g. Nahida).
    It is true they deal damage, but as they can be used 'off-field' they can also function as supports for things like elemental application, etc.
  </p><p>
    Indeed the way Topaz's kit works is almost like Nahida in the sense that:
    her E marks an enemy and does coordinated attack damage (Numby),
    and her Q buffs her coordinated attack's damage.
    Moreover, Topaz can have 100% uptime with her E.
  </p><p>
    The difference between Nahida and Albedo is that Albedo appears to be more single target,
    whereas Nahida can mark multiple enemies.
    So here Topaz is a bit more similar to Albedo.
    However, it appears that Topaz can do more damage than Albedo as 
    1) Topaz scales with ATK (and can receive many ATK buffs),
