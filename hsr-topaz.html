  <p>Topaz is a fire ST damage dealer.
    The way she works is almost similar to Albedo.
    Rather than being a 'hypercarry' or 'dps' (like Seele),
    Topaz is more of a subdps who can deal coordinated damage (via her trotter Numby) alongside your main dps.
    So rather than using her as the sole dps on the team, she can be paired with your dps and deal 'off-field' damage like Albedo.
  </p><p>
    So Topaz falls into a class of units that could be called 'sub-dps' in Genshin.
    Besides Albedo, some other <a href='subdps.html'>subdps</a> in Genshin include Nahida, Yae, Fischl, even Kuki and Raiden (hyperbloom).
