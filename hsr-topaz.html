<title>Topaz</title>

<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  
  <p>Topaz is a fire ST damage dealer.
    The way she works is almost similar to Albedo.
    Rather than being a 'hypercarry' or 'dps' (like Seele),
    Topaz is more of a subdps who can deal coordinated damage (via her trotter Numby) alongside your main dps.
    So rather than using her as the sole dps on the team, she can be paired with your dps and deal 'off-field' damage like Albedo.
  </p><p>
    So Topaz falls into a class of units that could be called 'sub-dps' in Genshin.
    Besides Albedo, some other <a href='subdps.html'>subdps</a> (via E) in Genshin include 
    Nahida, Dehya, Yae, Fischl, even Kuki and Raiden (for hyperbloom).
    There are also subdps via Q such as Beidou, XQ, Yelan,
    but here Topaz is more of a subdps via E (skill).
  </p><p>
    Some of the best characters/supports in Genshin are subdps (e.g. Nahida).
    It is true they deal damage, but as they can be used 'off-field' they can also function as supports for things like elemental application, etc.
  </p><p>
    Indeed the way Topaz's kit works is almost like Nahida in the sense that:
    her E marks an enemy and does coordinated attack damage (Numby),
    and her Q buffs her coordinated attack's damage.
    Moreover, Topaz can have 100% uptime with her E, similar to Albedo and Nahida.
  </p><p>
    The difference between Nahida and Albedo is that Albedo appears to be more single target,
    whereas Nahida can mark multiple enemies.
    So here Topaz is a bit more similar to Albedo.
    However, it appears that Topaz can do more damage than Albedo as 
    1) Topaz scales with ATK (and can receive many ATK buffs), whereas Albedo scales with DEF (which is usually only buffed by Gorou),
    2) Topaz's scalings appear higher and can be buffed by her own Q.
  </p>


  <h2>Kit</h2>
  <p>Topaz can actually do a lot of damage per hit for free: e.g. around 30k per Numby hit,
    which is actually considered high among Genshin E subdps (Nahida, Yae, etc.).
  </p><p>
    In Star Rail, Numby is a summon (like Jing Yuan's LL) that starts with 80 speed.
    It will inflict a random enemy with a debt mark at the start of battle.
    Using E can also be used to inflict a single enemy with a debt mark.
    This mark increases the dmg it takes from follow-up attacks by up to around 50%, which is quite big.
    When a marked enemy takes damage from follow-up attacks, Numby's action is advanced forward by 50%.
    When it is Numby's turn, it will deal fire damage to the marked enemy (around 160% scaling).
  </p><p>
    With one of Topaz's traces, her own basic atk will be considered as a follow-up attack.
    Other follow-up attacks include Jing Yuan's LL, Blade's passive, Himeko's chainsaw, Herta's passive, Kafka's gun, Svarog's passive, etc.
    So Topaz can synergize well with these units.
  </p>
  <p>Topaz's Q buffs Numby's damage.
    It will double the scaling and increase the crit dmg by around 25%.
    Moreover, when allies' basic atk, E, Q hit the marked enemy, it will also advance Numby's action by 50%.
    This buffed state ends after Numby uses 2 attacks.
  </p>
  <p>So Topaz is not exactly like Albedo.
    Albedo's E will do coordinated atk whenever allies damage the enemy in the field (with an icd of 2s).
    By contrast, Numby may not immediately deal a coordinated atk when allies damage the enemies.
    Its action needs to be advanced by follow-up attacks.
    And even within Q, other types of attacks can advance Numby's action.
  </p><p>
    As each attack can advance Numby by up to 50% (so two attacks up to 100%),
    this is almost like saying every 2 hits in Albedo's field will proc his solar isotoma damage.
