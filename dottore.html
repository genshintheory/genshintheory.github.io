  <p>Killing Niwa, the ancestor of yoshinori and kazuha,
    is definitely an impressive thing to put on one's resume.
    But Dottore did it.
  </p><p>
    Causing a nuclear disaster at Tatarasuna to create a 'minor inconvenience' to an entire nation
    sounds exactly like something the USA hegemonic military would do.
    But Dottore did it.
  </p><p>
    Using your fellow Fatui Scaramouche as a test experiment for hundreds of years,
    even causing him to destroy the Niwa clan and kazuha's ancestors
    sounds like stepping on and exterminating pests.
    And Dottore did it.
  </p><p>
    And this was just completing Jester's assignment.
    So then what kind of person is Pierro, the mage of Khaenriah?
  </p>

  <p>But still be careful of Dottore.
    Similar to how Wu Sangui backstabbed both the Ming and Qing dynasties,
    Dottore appears to be a kind of double dealer, 
    also having had multiple clones and versions of himself before his deal with Nahida.
