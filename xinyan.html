  <p>
  	For 3 years, Xinyan was the 4 star with the highest base atk at 249.
  	(Albedo and Morax have 251 atk.)
    But then Freminet came in 4.0 and Gaming came in 4.4.
    Damn, the times, they sure are a changin'.
  </p><p>
  	Xinyan scales with DEF.
  	Her E shield scales with her DEF.
  	Whiteblind and redhorn are good weapons for her.
  </p><p>
  	At c2 Xinyan gets 100% cr on her Q.
  	Her Q does physical damage and is a nuke.
