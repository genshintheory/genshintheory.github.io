  <p>Arlan is an electro destruction character that uses a sword in battle.
    He is perhaps a prototype for what a continuous hp-draining destruction character looks like in Star Rail.
    In Genshin, Xiao was the original destruction character with continuous hp drain for years until Fontaine came.
  </p><p>
    His E drains his hp to do more damage.
    His E does not cost sp (but does not generate any).
    So he has a choice of using his ba or e (drain hp).
    His Q has 110 energy cost and does a blast nuke.
