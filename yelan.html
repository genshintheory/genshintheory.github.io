<p>Yelan is a hydro bow 5 star that released alongside Xiao in 2.7.
  Based on her kit, she appears to be a cross between Ganyu and Xingqiu.
  Her CA is similar to Ganyu's, and her Q is similar to Xingqiu's.
</p>

<h2>Talents</h2>
<p>Most of her damage scales with her max HP: her breakthrough CA, E skill, and Q burst.</p>

<h3>AA</h3>
<p>When spending 5s out of combat she obtains the breakthrough effect, 
  reducing CA time by 80% and allowing her to do an aoe CA similar to Ganyu.
  The breakthrough aoe CA damage scales with HP.
  Her normal CA scales with ATK.
  Using her E can also help her gain breakthrough.
</p><p>
  Her NA and PA scale with ATK.
  While NA she kicks her bow (who does that?).
</p><p>
  Note her aoe CA can vaporize (2x damage), whereas Ganyu's CA can only melt (1.5x damage).
</p>

<h3>Skill</h3>
<p>Her skill allows her to dash and tag enemies with a string (lifeline).
  Tagged enemies will then be damaged and knockbacked a certain degree.
  Each tagged enemy gives 33% chance for Yelan to obtain the breakthrough effect (allowing special aoe CA).
  If there are n enemies the probability of obtaining breakthrough is about
  $$1-(1-1/3)^n = 1 - (2/3)^n$$
  In other words it increases with n.
  Her E has a 10s cd, which is much shorter than Xingqiu's 18s cd.
  Yelan's E is generally better against mobs and in aoe situations than Xingqiu's E.
</p>

<h3>Burst</h3>
<p>Her burst is similar to Xingqiu's.
  She does an initial aoe hit of hydro and summons a dice (exquisite throw).
  The dice will shoot out 3 arrows upon NA or Yelan E.
  All Q damage scales with Yelan's max HP.
  It lasts 15s, has a cd of 18s, energy cost of 70, so it is cheaper than Xingqiu's burst (80 energy).
</p><p>
  But wait, if her damage scales with HP, does that mean she does not get Bennett's ATK buff?
  Yes that's true, but Genshin actually made her HP scalings high enough to compensate for that fact.
  That makes her very flexible on teams that do not need Bennett (or if Bennett is on your other abyss team).
</p>

<h3>Passives</h3>
<p>One passive boosts her HP depending on how many different element characters are in the party (similar to Yun Jin's passive).
  Another passive increases the active character's dmg bonus while her Q is active 
  (starts at 1%, goes to 50%, increasing 3.5% every second).
</p>

<h3>Making qiu retire</h3>
<p>For a comparison between Yelan and Xingqiu:
  C0 Yelan is obviously better than C0-C5 Xingqiu.
  You really want to compare C0 Yelan with C6 Xingqiu.
</p><p>
  Yelan will typically do more damage and provide more offensive support to the team,
  whereas Xingqiu can provide some more defensive support (rainswords heal and reduce damage).
  Moreover, Yelan is much better in AoE situations with her special CA and E allowing her to tag mobs of enemies.
</p><p>
  If you're not using Bennett, a C0 Yelan can easily out damage a C6 Xingqiu.
  If you are using Bennett, then a C0 Yelan and C6 Xingqiu may provide similar sub-dps Q damage,
  but Yelan can still provide more damage overall because of her CA and E skills.
</p><p>
  In terms of hydro application, C0 Yelan is good enough to compete with C6 Xingqiu.
  Yelan's Q does 3 per hit, whereas for C6 Xingqiu it is 2-3-5 (a bit more irregular), 
  even with Xingqiu's orbiting rainswords.
  If you have C2 Yelan, her hydro application powercreeps Xingqiu.
  If you have C4 Yelan, she becomes bis support for Hu Tao teams (because of party HP buff).
</p><p>
  And needless to say, C6 Yelan powercreeps Xingqiu in every possible way.
  But at that point, Yelan becomes a dps in her own right.
</p>


<h2>Constellations</h2>
<p>C1: extra charge is fine<br>
  C2: q fires 4th shot once in a while, increases hydro application, makes Yelan clearly better than XQ in all aspects<br>
  C4: hp buff for all party members<br>
  C6: enables more dps-focused Yelan, during her Q, each NA will do breakthrough CA damage
</p>

<h2>Build</h2>
<p>
  Artifacts: 4p emblem, 2p heart/2p tenacity, 2p heart/2p noblesse, even 4p wanderer's if you care about her CA.
  HP sands, Hydro goblet, crit circlet.
  Substats: crit, HP, ER.
</p><p>
  Weapons: Aqua Simulacra is her clear bis. Other 5 star bows like TP, Skyward, Polar, Elegy are good.
  4 star bows like Sac, Favonius, Stringless, Viridescent Hunt, Fading Twilight (2.7 event bow) are good.
  Even 3 star bows with crit are usable since Yelan scales with HP.
  In general looking for crit, ER and HP on the bow.
</p>

<h2>Teams</h2>
<p>Anywhere you would use Xingqiu, you can replace Xingqiu with Yelan.
  Some notes: C4 Yelan's hp buff synergizes well with Hu Tao/Zhongli teams.
  Yelan even at C0 works perfectly fine with Yoimiya as Yoimiya does not care too much about hydro application,
  but cares more about Yelan's sub-dps.
</p><p>
  Yelan can be played more as a dps than Xingqiu since Yelan does have the CA mechanic.
  This becomes more pronounced at C6.
</p>

<h2>Calculations</h2>
<p>Yelan scales with HP. To compare this dps to other users, we will set up a way to convert HP scaling
  into an equivalent ATK scaling value.
  Yelan has pretty high base HP, and with an HP sands, she can comfortably reach 30k HP.
  Meanwhile, most ATK scaling characters can say reach around 2k attack.
  With Bennett, ATK scaling characters can reach 3k attack.
  In other words, one can expect the HP to be around 10-15 times more than the total ATK.
  So to convert an HP scaling talent to an equivalent ATK scaling one,
  multiply the number by 10 (if using Bennett) to 15 (if not using Bennett).
</p><p>
  There are two sides to HP scaling.
  On one hand, HP scaling talents are not affected by Bennett's ATK buff (one of the most broken buffs in the game).
  Moreover, there is currently no 'HP Bennett'. There is a 'DEF Bennett' (Gorou) who buffs characters' DEF.
  But there is no character who increases HP for all characters.
  This means HP characters usually need to rely on their pure HP scaling multipliers
  unless an HP Bennett releases in the future.
  Note there are passives/constellations that can buff hp (like Ayato C2 or Yelan C4),
  but this is still a far cry from an 'HP Bennett'.
  Yelan's C4 is probably the closest by buffing party members' HP (making her arguably the BiS support for Hu Tao/Morax teams), 
  but how many people will be able to afford her C4?
</p><p>
  On the other hand, HP scaling characters do not need to have Bennett on their team,
  which makes team building more flexible.
</p><p>
  Based on the rule of multiplying by 10, Yelan's Q scaling is very similar to C6 Xingqiu's Q.
  So for C0 Yelan to do similar sub-dps to C6 Xingqiu means her dps is pretty good
  as C6 Xingqiu is one of the best sub-dps in the game.
</p>

<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>In her test run, she had 206.8% ER, 32556 hp, 105 em, 71.5% cr, 172.4% cd, with Aqua Simulacra and 4p Emblem. The build was pretty good.</p>
