<p>Yelan is a hydro bow 5 star that will release alongside Xiao.
  Based on her kit, she appears to be a cross between Ganyu and Xingqiu.
  Her CA is similar to Ganyu's, and her Q is similar to Xingqiu's.
  More info will be added after she releases (May 31).
</p>

<h2>Constellations</h2>
<p>C1: extra charge is fine<br>
  C2: q fires 4th shot once in a while, increases hydro application, makes Yelan clearly better than XQ in all aspects<br>
  C4: hp buff for all party members<br>
  C6: enables more dps-focused Yelan
</p>

<h2>Build</h2>
<p>
  Artifacts: 4p emblem, 2p heart/2p tenacity, 2p heart/2p noblesse, even 4p wanderer's if you care about her CA.
  HP sands, Hydro goblet, crit circlet.
  Substats: crit, HP, ER.
</p><p>
  Weapons: Aqua Simulacra is her clear bis. Other 5 star bows like TP, Skyward, Polar, Elegy are good.
  4 star bows like Sac, Favonius, Stringless, Viridescent Hunt, Fading Twilight (2.7 event bow) are good.
  Even 3 star bows with crit are usable since Yelan scales with HP.
  In general looking for crit, ER and HP on the bow.
</p>

<h2>Teams</h2>
<p>Anywhere you would use Xingqiu, you can replace Xingqiu with Yelan.
  Some notes: C4 Yelan's hp buff synergizes well with Hu Tao/Zhongli teams.
  Yelan even at C0 works perfectly fine with Yoimiya as Yoimiya does not care too much about hydro application,
  but cares more about Yelan's sub-dps.
</p><p>
  Yelan can be played more as a dps than Xingqiu since Yelan does have the CA mechanic.
  This becomes more pronounced at C6.
</p>

<h2>Calculations</h2>
<p>Yelan scales with HP. To compare this dps to other users, we will set up a way to convert HP scaling
  into an equivalent ATK scaling value.
  Yelan has pretty high base HP, and with an HP sands, she can comfortably reach 30k HP.
  Meanwhile, most ATK scaling characters can say reach around 2k attack.
  With Bennett, ATK scaling characters can reach 3k attack.
  In other words, one can expect the HP to be around 10-15 times more than the total ATK.
  So to convert an HP scaling talent to an equivalent ATK scaling one,
  multiply the number by 10 (if using Bennett) to 15 (if not using Bennett).
</p><p>
  There are two sides to HP scaling.
  On one hand, HP scaling talents are not affected by Bennett's ATK buff (one of the most broken buffs in the game).
  Moreover, there is currently no 'HP Bennett'. There is a 'DEF Bennett' (Gorou) who buffs characters' DEF.
  But there is no character who increases HP for all characters.
  This mean HP characters usually need to rely on their pure HP scaling multipliers
  unless an HP Bennett releases in the future.
  Note there are passives/constellations that can buff hp (like Ayato C2 or Yelan C4),
  but this is still a far cry from an 'HP Bennett'.
  Yelan's C4 is probably the closest by buffing party members' HP (making her arguably the BiS support for Hu Tao/Morax teams), 
  but how many people will be able to afford her C4?
</p><p>
  On the other hand, HP scaling characters do not need to have Bennett on their team,
  which makes team building more flexible.
</p><p>
  Based on the rule of multiplying by 10, Yelan's Q scaling is very similar to C6 Xingqiu's Q.
  So for C0 Yelan to do similar sub-dps to C6 Xingqiu means her dps is pretty good
  as C6 Xingqiu is one of the best sub-dps in the game.
