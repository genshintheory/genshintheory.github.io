    <title>Version 3.7</title>

  <p>Kirara and Charlotte (Fontaine) are introduced.
    It seems Diona and Yanfei have some things in common with these characters.
    Charlotte is a reporter and photographer working for the Steambird.
    The flagship event will focus on the card game <a href='tcg.html'>TCG</a>.
  </p>

  <p>Yoimiya becomes the first non-archon character to receive a part 2 to her story quest.
  </p>
  <p>First banner features Yoimiya, Yae with Kirara (weapon banner 5 stars quite good).
    Second banner features Alhaitham and Kazuha 
    (the Aisin Gioro and Yehe Nara pair / the Qing Yuan pair).
  </p>

  <p>Version 3.7 will also have a hangout with Kaveh.
    This will most likely be the worst hangout series in the game,
    especially if Alhaitham is involved.
    It's not something worth looking forward to.
  </p>


  <h2>Summoner's Summit</h2>
  <p>In the TCG-focused flagship event, we learn that the 'vi' sound can be transliterated as Âê† fei,
    a character that has been used when translating things related to South Asian history and religion.
  </p><p>
    Is Garvipidam supposed to be a reference to something?
    Because the Japanese voice actor could refer to someone who just got laid off 
    for unprofessionalism, not caring much about others, and disrespecting their seniors.
    Amusing.
