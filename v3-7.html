    <title>Version 3.7</title>
  </head>
 
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>
  

  <p>Kirara and Charlotte (Fontaine) are introduced.
    It seems Diona and Yanfei have some things in common with these characters.
    Charlotte is a reporter and photographer working for the Steambird.
    The flagship event will focus on the card game <a href='tcg.html'>TCG</a>.
  </p>

  <p>Yoimiya becomes the first non-archon character to receive a part 2 to her story quest.
  </p>
  <p>First banner features Yoimiya, Yae with Kirara (weapon banner 5 stars quite good).
    Second banner features Alhaitham and Kazuha 
    (the Aisin Gioro and Yehe Nara pair / the Qing Yuan pair).
  </p>

  <p>Version 3.7 will also have a hangout with Kaveh.
    This will most likely be the worst hangout series in the game,
    especially if Alhaitham is involved.
    It's not something worth looking forward to.
  </p>


  <h2>Summoner's Summit</h2>
  <p>In the TCG-focused flagship event, we learn that the 'vi' sound can be transliterated as Âê† fei,
    a character that has been used when translating things related to South Asian history and religion.
  </p><p>
    Is Garvipidam supposed to be a reference to something?
    Because the Japanese voice actor could refer to someone who just got laid off 
    for unprofessionalism, not caring much about others, and disrespecting their seniors.
    Amusing.
  </p>


  <h2>Divine Ingenuity</h2>
  <p>On day 3, we get to trial Noelle.
    At the end we can summon additional units.
    One of those is ganyu, another reference to someone who just got laid off.
    Surprised hu tao was not put there either.
    It would have completed the joke.
    But kokomi was placed there as a substitute.
  </p>


  <h2>Departed warriors battle event</h2>
  <p>The three bosses are the thunderbird, blightdrake, and bathysmal vishaps.</p>
  <p>Hyperbloom works each day.
    Itto works on day 1 and 3.
    Day 3 would like characters that deal heavy damage, such as claymores, Xiao, Cyno, geo, etc.
  </p>


  <h2>Comments</h2>
  <p>For these combat events (in versions 3.0, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7) where you get to select trial characters,
    whoever decided the order of characters needs to be inspected or even replaced.
    They clearly seem to discriminate against people based on name.
    Moreover, they hardly ever put hu or li in the 4th position, further proving bias.
    Perhaps their mother or wife is named hu or li.
