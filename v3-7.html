  <p>It is rumored that 3.7 will have a hangout with Kaveh.
    This will most likely be the worst hangout series in the game,
    especially if Alhaitham is involved.
    It's not something worth looking forward to.
  </p>

  <p>Kirara and Charlotte (Fontaine) are introduced.
    It seems Diona and Yanfei have some things in common with these characters.
    Charlotte is a reporter and photographer working for the Steambird.
