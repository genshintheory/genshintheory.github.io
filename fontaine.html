  <h2>Fontaine</h2>
  <p>Fontaine contains various references to the Bioshock video game franchise.
    Atlas Fontaine is the name of the antagonist in Bioshock and is also a reference to the Fountainhead by Ayn Rand.
    The Steambird magazine (that Mona writes for) could be a reference to the Steambird guarding Elizabeth's tower in Bioshock infinite.
    Fontaine is also the nation of water, and Bioshock takes place in Rapture, an underwater city.
    Some say there are allusions to French culture, and indeed in Bioshock Infinite, we do see glimpses of Paris.
  </p><p>
    Besides France, Fontaine also contains various influences from American culture.
    Rock and Roll originated from Fontaine, just like how Rock originated from the USA in the 1940s and 1950s.
    Xinyan also specializes in rock and roll.
    But moreover, the Bioshock series themselves are based on USA in different periods of time.
    Bioshock Infinite focuses more on USA during the Gilded Age,
    the expansion west after the Civil War, African-Americans, the Chinese Exclusion Act,
    even mentioning the Boxer rebellion during the late Qing dynasty.
    The first Bioshock by contrast focuses on the USA around and after WW2 and defeating the Nazis (recall Dr. Tenenbaum and Su Chong).
  </p><p>
    The French influence is not that surprising since historically USA has had close ties to France.
    The French helped the USA defeat the British and claim independence from the British empire.
    Even the founding fathers traveled to France to solicit war help and sympathy.
    Later, USA businessmen would also go to Europe to help bail out France when it got invaded by Prussia.
    In the Louisiana Purchase, USA bought territory from France.
    The Declaration of Independence and history of the early USA are heavily influenced by French politics, language, and culture too.
    This is similar to how the English language (a Germanic language) contains a huge portion of French vocabulary
    when the French invaded and conquered England 1000 years ago and ruled as the elites.
  </p><p>    
    Lastly, the American legal system (when it was founded) is inspired by the French legal code as well.
    Fontaine is the nation of justice, and the archon of Fontaine seeks to judge all other gods.
    Does this sound like France? Or even other countries in Europe like the UK?
    To be honest, this really sounds like the USA hegemon, the world police that interferes in the affairs of every country around the world.
    The USA acts like the executive, judicial, and legal branch trying to stick its head and lay its greasy fingers to govern the affairs of the entire world.
    When treating its own people, the USA likes to tout lofty principles such as balance of power, freedom of speech, democracy, and equality,
    but when facing the rest of the world, the USA wants no balance of power, acts like a dictator commanding the rest of the world,
    suppressing free speech to sell their own propaganda, jingoism, narrative, while exporting color revolution in the false name of 'demoncrazy'
    to make the world even more unequal, to widen the gap between the USA and the rest, to line the pockets of USA imperialists and capitalists.
    It is because of this characterization that Fontaine sounds like the USA, an arrogant empire that thinks it can judge the rest of the world,
    a biased media machine that uses double standards to promote their own interests while blaming everybody else.

    And if Focalors is the archon of Fontaine, then one begins to think of various families that influenced the development of the USA and West Europe,
    including the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Roosevelts (罗斯福).
    Remember the correspondence between Luo (罗) in Chinese and the sound Ro in the English language
    as the people behind Genshin are particularly fond about this particular sound:
    whether it is Rosaria, Rosalyn, Chlothar, and of course, who can forget Pierro, the leader of the Fatui.
    Speaking of Pierro, this brings to mind another influential family of the USA that went head to head with the Rockefellers and Roosevelts,
    a banking dynasty that shaped American finance during the Gilded Age, including a man who shares the same birthday with Xiao 
    and whose name resembles the currency used universally throughout Teyvat.
    What can one expect from Focalors and the nation of justice?
  </p><p>
    Of course, much of this is speculation and what Fontaine represents will become clearer when it releases.
