  <h2>Fontaine: Bioshock, France, Britain, and the USA</h2>
  <p>Fontaine contains various references to the Bioshock video game franchise.
    Atlas Fontaine is the name of the antagonist in Bioshock and is also a reference to 
    'The Fountainhead' and 'Atlas Shrugged' by Ayn Rand (known for Objectivism).
    The Steambird magazine (that Mona writes for) could be a reference to the Steambird guarding Elizabeth's tower in Bioshock Infinite.
    Fontaine is also the nation of water, and Bioshock takes place in Rapture, an underwater city.
    Some say there are allusions to French culture, and indeed in Bioshock Infinite, we do see glimpses of Paris.
  </p><p>
    Besides France, Fontaine also contains various influences from American culture.
    Rock and Roll originated from Fontaine, just like how Rock originated from the USA in the 1940s and 1950s.
    Xinyan also specializes in rock and roll.
    But moreover, the Bioshock series itself is based on the USA in different periods of time.
    Bioshock Infinite focuses more on USA during the Gilded Age,
    the expansion west after the Civil War, African-Americans, the Chinese Exclusion Act, the genocide of the Native-Americans,
    even mentioning the Boxer rebellion during the late Qing dynasty.
    The first Bioshock by contrast focuses on the USA around and after WW2 and defeating the Nazis (recall Dr. Tenenbaum and Su Chong).
  </p><p>
    The French influence is not that surprising since historically USA has had close ties to France.
    The French helped the USA defeat the British and claim independence from the British empire.
    Even the founding fathers traveled to France to solicit war help and sympathy.
    Later, USA businessmen would also go to Europe to help bail out France when it got invaded by Prussia.
    In the Louisiana Purchase, USA bought territory from France.
    The Declaration of Independence and history of the early USA are heavily influenced by French politics, language, and culture too.
    This is similar to how the English language (a Germanic language) contains a huge lexicon of French vocabulary
    when the French invaded and conquered England 1000 years ago and ruled as the elites.
  </p><p>    
    Lastly, the American legal system (when it was founded) was inspired by the French legal code as well.
    Fontaine is the nation of justice, and the archon of Fontaine seeks to judge all other gods.
    Does this sound like France? Or even other countries in Europe like the UK?
    To be honest, this really sounds like the USA hegemon, the global police that interferes in the affairs of every country around the world.
    The USA acts like the executive, judicial, and legislative branch trying to stick its head 
    and lay its greasy fingers (that had one too many servings of McDonald's) 
    and Standard Oily slimy tentacles to govern the affairs of the entire world.
  </p><p>
    When treating its own people, the USA likes to tout lofty principles such as balance of power, freedom of speech, democracy, and equality,
    but when facing the rest of the world, the USA wants no balance of power, acts like a dictator commanding the rest of the world,
    suppressing free speech to sell their own propaganda, jingoism, narrative, while exporting color revolution in the false name of 'demoncrazy'
    to make the world even more unequal, to widen the gap between the USA and the rest, to line the pockets of USA imperialists and capitalists.
    It is because of this characterization that Fontaine sounds like the USA, an arrogant empire that thinks it can judge the rest of the world,
    a biased media machine that uses double standards to promote their own interests while blaming everybody else.
  </p><p>
    And if Focalors is the archon of Fontaine, then one begins to think of various families that influenced the development of the USA and West Europe,
    including the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Roosevelts (罗斯福).
    Remember the correspondence between Luo (罗/洛) in Chinese and the sound Ro in the English language
    as the people behind Genshin are particularly fond about this particular sound:
    whether it is Rosaria, Chlothar, Charlotte, Rosalyn, Kujou Sara, Luocha, Svarog, Aisin Gioro, 
    and of course who can forget Pierro, the leader of the Fatui.
    Speaking of Pierro, this brings to mind another influential family of the USA that went head to head with the Rockefellers and Roosevelts,
    a banking dynasty that shaped American finance during the Gilded Age, including a man who shares the same birthday with Xiao 
    and whose name resembles the currency used universally throughout Teyvat.
    What can one expect from Focalors and the nation of justice?
  </p><p>
    Of course, much of this is speculation and what Fontaine represents will become clearer when it releases.
  </p>


  <h2>The hydro element</h2>
  <p>Fontaine is also the nation of water. Perhaps we can expect to swim a lot, including diving underwater.
    Hydro is connected to west European nations as many of them built ships and navies that sailed around the world,
    settling in the Americas and colonizing the lands.
  </p><p>
    Hydro is connected to the USA in a number of symbolic ways: the USA is a country with two coasts, surrounded by oceans (Atlantic and Pacific).
    The USA was founded by people who crossed the ocean on boats searching for a new land.
    For a period of time, the USA built the strongest navy in the world, surpassing the British empire.
    In 1890, the American Alfred Thayer Mahan published "The Influence of Sea Power upon History", a classic in naval warfare. 
    The steamboat was invented in the USA in 1807 by Robert Fulton and features in Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn.
    The USA is a rich country with many rivers flowing through it and an abundance of farmland and vegetation for growing crops.
    The USA is slippery like water when it comes to geopolitics, engaging in color revolutions around the world.
    As Rhodeia of Loch says, the form of water is to 'take any shape', and indeed the USA CIA likes to take various forms
    when acting as covert agents, spies, hackers, and fake water army accounts to overthrow their political enemies.
    In fact, if there is any term to describe the USA hegemon on the Internet, 'water army' is one of them, suiting the description of a nation of water.
  </p><p>
    France or the USA? UK or France?
    As it stands, the source of inspiration for Fontaine is like a Tale of Two Cities,
    and there are Great Expectations (and maybe not so great ones) going forward on how the nation of justice will turn out.
    It is the best of times but also the worst of times.
    Like Schrodinger's cat, the state of Fontaine is in a kind of superposition. 
    We do not know the exact state of it.
    One dares not open the box until 4.0 actually comes out.
  </p>

  
  <h2>The -isms: Capitalism, Socialism, Communism</h2>
  <p></p>


  <h2>The original sin and great flood</h2>
  <p>It is mentioned in the Fontaine quest that there is a prophecy that everybody in the nation will drown.
    This is a bit reminiscent of the great flood mentioned in Abrahamic religions and the Bible.
    The original sin is also alluded to.
  </p><p>
    If Islam played a big role in the culture of Sumeru,
    then Christianity (and Judaism) has played a similar role in the history and culture of Fontaine.
    Many major historical events in west Europe (England, France)
    have been tied to religion, including Protestantism, Catholicism, etc.
  </p><p>
    Christianity has also been an important aspect in the history of the USA,
    with the Manifest Destiny being seen as a civilizing mission to tame the wild west and convert the barbarians.
    So the expansion of the British, French, and USA empires 
    has often coincided with the spread of the Christian faith to other parts of the world.
  </p><p>
    While seen as ordained by God, this spread of Christianity has historically had political ramifications as well,
    such as when drugs were smuggled into the Qing dynasty, prompting the Opium Wars, Taiping rebellion, etc.
  </p><p>
    The Bioshock games just so happen to incorporate heavy amounts of Christian themes in the gameplay and design.
    Bioshock is also famous for incorporating Ayn Rand's Objectivism, which can prioritize the concept of people over even gods.
    There is some philosophical conversation on whether Christianity and Objectivism are compatible, whether they can be integrated or not.
    In Genshin, the civilization of Khaenriah refused to look up to the gods.
    There are even those in Teyvat that seek to overthrow the gods.
    This may not necessarily mean such people are objectivist, but there are certain philosophical themes going on in the Genshin lore.
  </p>


  <h2>The American Dream</h2>
  <p>Dreams (梦) are a recurring topic in Genshin (perhaps for cultural reasons),
    appearing in the Inazuma and Sumeru storylines (with Raiden and Nahida).
    So how does the nation and culture of Fontaine tie to dreams?
  </p>
  <p>America was founded by immigrants.
    To this day, every year, immigrants from all around the world move to the USA to pursue the so-called American Dream,
    to find a new life and to become a new person in a new land.
  </p><p>
    There is no requirement for dreams to feature in the Fontaine arc,
    which seems more focused on the spectacle of the courtroom.
    Nor do dreams feature much in the Mondstadt or Liyue arcs.
    It is just something to be mentioned in connection with how the USA sells its image to the rest of the world (via the so-called 'soft power').
  </p>


  <h2>Trivia</h2>
  <p>The kamera was invented in Fontaine, similar to how the real life camera was invented in France in 1825.</p>
