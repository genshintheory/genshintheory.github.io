<h2>Dynasties</h2>
<p>Some people claim the meta shifts due to changes in the spiral abyss.
  If we focus really on Floors 9-12, with special emphasis on Floor 12, then there are versions that give certain characters an edge.
  But basically:
</p>

<h3>Version 1: Venti dynasty</h3>
<p>Versions 1.0-2.0: the Venti dynasty, where Venti was single handedly the most op support in the game 
  as most enemies could be pulled and lifted by his Q
</p>

<h3>Version 2: Raiden dynasty</h3>
<p>
  Versions 2.1-3.1: could be called the Raiden dynasty, as it saw the introduction of several gimmicks that gave Raiden an advantage in abyss
  such as electro rifthounds, energy manipulation, etc.
  During this period, while geo rifthounds were introduced to benefit Itto, 
  Zhongli took a big hit as the rifthounds and various similar effects bleed through shields.
  Moreover, the new 2.5 shadowy husk enemies further penalize you for simply using a shield (they spawn a shield if you have a shield).
  While Zhongli fell in the rankings, Venti also took a big hit as during this period, many of the enemies in Floor 12
  are just heavier and cannot be easily pulled and lifted by his Q.
  Seeing how these versions featured the addition of Inazuma,
  it is interesting that the Mondstadt (蒙德) archon does not fare as effectively in Floor 12
  as the Mongols (蒙古) were thwarted by hurricanes when they tried to invade Japan centuries ago (during the Yuan dynasty).
</p><p>
  As Zhongli and Venti fell, so did Ganyu as her two teams melt Ganyu and Morgana that rely on these archons simply do not work as well anymore.
  Zhongli and Ganyu teams are not hot during this era.
  Most people (including the FBI/CIA/NSA cybermob agents that crawl the internet) have given up on Zhongli and Ganyu.  
</p><p>
  The Raiden dynasty is marked by an increased shift to healing as a source of defense.
  During this period, the Raiden national team has shown its versatility.
  And as always, Xiao, Venti, Bennett are top tier meta.
  One of the biggest rising stars during this era is Itto, the new Geo dps.
  Itto is basically the best option against the geo rifthounds that appear during these versions.
  Moreover, unlike Zhongli, Itto relies more on his high defense to reduce incoming damage, 
  rather than shields, which fell out of the meta.
</p><p>
  Besides Raiden, other electro dps such as Yae, Beidou also benefit from the rifthound gimmick.
  Zhongli has a big feeling of being replaced. When Thoma was introduced, Hu Tao no longer needed Zhongli and could rely on Thoma as a better shield option.
  But since Zhongli had a boss like Hu Tao, it is understandable that Zhongli would retire and fake his own death anyways.
  Even Itto gets -20% Geo RES from geo resonance and does not really need Zhongli.
  So it is only for Xiao that Zhongli is not completely useless.
  Even when things turn to dust and after Ganyu and Hu Tao disappear from the meta,
  Zhongli will be remembered as the archon who protects his yaksha.
</p><p>
  But then 3.3 came and Faruzan was released, who provides more anemo res shred than zhongli.
  So zhongli lost his job serving Xiao as well.
</p>
<p>At this point, the only way to end Bennett's career in abyss is to penalize people for getting ATK buffs or healing.
  But it is unknown if Genshin has any intent currently to nerf Bennett.
</p>
<p>
  Before Version 2.3, Geo only had what? Zhongli, Ningguang. It was a virgin element.
  After Version 2.3 with the introduction of Itto and Yun Jin, Geo became a more chad element.
</p>

<h3>Version 3: Nahida dynasty</h3>
<p>Versions 3.2-: the Nahida dynasty</p>
