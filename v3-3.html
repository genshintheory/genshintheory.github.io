    <title>Version 3.3</title>

<p>Version 3.3 introduced Scaramouche and Faruzan,
  two new anemo characters.
</p><p>
  The Chinese title of the special program contains the term 六入 (liuru),
  which refers to the six senses:
  the sadayatana (from ayatana आयतन) in Buddhism.
</p><p>
  Indeed, it appears version 3.3 will have a lot to do with Liu.
</p>

<h2>New stuff</h2>
<p>There will be a new trading card game TCG called Genius Invokation (the one Cyno is fond of).
  You can challenge npcs (even cats) to the game.
  The game involves elemental dice (8 elements: the 7 elements of Teyvat plus an omni element).
</p>

<h2>Akitsu Kimodameshi</h2>
<p>This features a halloween like ghost festival in Inazuma.
  One of the minigames is an Atari breakout event.
</p><p>
    If you claim someone named nari or 永 is your heir,
    then this is not a way to make people respect you or your heir.
    Rather it will only make others despise your heir and you as well,
    especially if you make such an announcement while nuking others on Layla's birthday.
    What a complete joke.
    Anyone who claims nari is their heir is a complete laughing matter,
    the same kind of person who would get executed for running a mafia
    or sentenced 14 years in prison.
  </p>

<h2>Banners</h2>
<p>Phase 1 featured Scaramouche, Itto, Faruzan.</p>
<p>Phase 2 featured two female characters: Raiden and Ayato.</p>
<p>Public opinion recommends to stay away from phase 2 (featuring Raiden and Ayato).
  Stay away from the mid phase 2 weapon banner.
  Also, when someone like Childe exists, most people want to move Ayato to the standard banner.
</p>

<p>
  Scaramouche's banner name is a possible reference to Huo Yu (霍禹), who was executed during the Han dynasty.
  Scaramouche's Japanese name 放浪者 is a possible reference to 虞放 another Han dynasty person.
  But it could also refer to Fang Xiaoru.
</p>


<h2>Story</h2>
<p>Scaramouche was responsible for the deaths and suffering of Kazuha's ancestors centuries ago.
  Scaramouche erases himself from the Irminsul and the world, akin to what Rukkhadevata did.
