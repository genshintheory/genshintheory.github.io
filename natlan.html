  <h1>Evaluation</h1>
  <p>It appears Natlan will be the next stop on the Traveler's journey after Fontaine.
    The Natlan version will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>For the reputation rewards, the thing placed at lv4 and lv6 will reveal the biases and favoritism of certain game devs.
      This will be considered in the final evaluation.
    </li>
    <li>Cast of characters</li>
    <li>Archon quest: based on Fontaine's archon quest alone, version 4.x is the worst to date.
      In order for 4.x to perform better than 3.x or 2.x, it will need to compensate via other aspects,
      but as of now things are not looking promising for 4.x.
      It is unknown if Natlan AQ will outperform 4.x or follow the trend and get worse with each year.
    </li>
    <li>The choice of NPC names: 4.x suffers from the repetitive use of certain names for NPCs.
      This has negatively impacted the overall evaluation of 4.x.
      Excessive repitition is a sign of mental illness, and it is suggested certain designers be examined for such mental health issues.
      Moreover, it is recommended that they also be treated for such mental health problems and be replaced by people who are more sane.
    </li>    
    <li>Character story quests: both 3.x and 4.x (4.0, 4.1, 4.2)
      suffer from excessive political attacks made in character story quests.
      This has negatively impacted the evaluation of these versions.
    </li>
    <li>Politically-motivated scheduling: it has been observed that sometimes designers align events, quests, birthdays, and other dates 
      with certain real world events in order to make political attacks or statements.
      The more these kinds of attacks happen, the higher the risk that the versions will suffer and be negatively impacted in evaluation.
    </li>
    <li>Event quests (flagship events)</li>
    <li>Version cover art</li>
    <li>Choice of banners</li>
    <li>Voice actor selection: if it brings any solace, the selection of voice actors for the 4.x main cast
      is probably the best of any version in Genshin. 
      Therefore, it is highly doubtful that Natlan will be able to surpass Fontaine when it comes to selection of voice actors.
      However, we would love to be proven otherwise on this point.
      For example, the choice of voice actors for Lyney is probably the best of any character (near perfect)
      or at least very close to the choice of voice actors for Alice.
    </li>
    <li>The use of threats and blackmail: one negative thing introduced in 4.x is the increased use of threats and blackmail.
      Blackmail is a criminal offense punishable by law,
      along with entrapment, doxxing, defamation, falsifying information, etc.
      Obviously, the use of threats and blackmail will negatively impact the evaluation of versions,
      but another thing to worry about are the legal consequences of such blackmail.
    </li>
    <li>Commissions: this is linked to NPC names, but as commissions are posted daily,
      there is potential for people to abuse monopoly over media and continuously spam and repeat things.
      Commissions in each nation so far (Mond, Liyue, Inazuma, Sumeru, Fontaine)
      contain some form of political bias and discrimination against people based on name,
      thereby negatively impacting the entire game experience as a whole.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>If certain people want to continue down the path of 3.x and 4.x,
    then they should not be surprised when their choices are reflected in the final evaluation of Natlan's versions.
  </p><p>
    Also, all of the decisions made in 3.x and 4.x will be remembered when Natlan releases.
    Considering that Natlan is the nation of war...

  <h1>Dev's template for creating versions</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>5.0: release CA bow dps with local specialty passive and two 4* related to that bow dps,
      only release one 5* so they have a monopoly on all the pics of the new region,
      only build monopolies around people with certain names while excluding everybody else,
      that is the attitude some people have (only I can have a monopoly, nobody else can have a monopoly)
    </li>
    <li>5.1: release high-ranked Natlan character, release two 5*, anniversary version</li>
    <li>5.2: release archon</li>
    <li>5.3: the Liu version, the Natlan character that Liu has the most bias/favoritism to is released in this version</li>
    <li>5.4: lantern rite (Xiao version)</li>
    <li>5.5: release a waifu</li>
    <li>5.6: the other Liu version, prepare for a surprise and pray to not get a heart attack</li>
    <li>5.7/5.8: summer is around this time, usually some Klee event occurs at the end</li>
  </ul>
