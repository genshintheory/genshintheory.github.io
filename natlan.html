  <h1>Evaluation</h1>
  <p>It appears Natlan will be the next stop on the Traveler's journey after Fontaine.
    The Natlan version will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>For the reputation rewards, the thing placed at lv4 and lv6 will reveal the biases and favoritism of certain game devs.
      This will be considered in final evaluation.
    </li>
    <li>Cast of characters</li>
    <li>Archon quest: based on Fontaine's archon quest alone, version 4.x is the worst to date.
      In order for 4.x to perform better than 3.x or 2.x, it will need to compensate via other aspects,
      but as of now things are not looking promising for 4.x.
      It is unknown if Natlan AQ will outperform 4.x or follow the trend and get worse with each year.
    </li>
    <li>The choice of NPC names: 4.x suffers from the repetitive use of certain names for NPCs.
      This has negatively impacted the overall evaluation of 4.x.
      Excessive repitition is a sign of mental illness, and it is suggested certain designers be examined for such mental health issues.
      Moreover, it is recommended that they also be treated for such mental health problems and be replaced by people who are more sane.
    </li>
    <li>Character story quests: both 3.x and 4.x (4.0, 4.1, 4.2)
      suffer from excessive political attacks made in character story quests.
      This has negatively impacted the evaluation of these versions.
    </li>
    <li>Politically-motivated scheduling: it has been observed that sometimes designers align events, quests, birthdays, and other dates 
      with certain real world events in order to make political attacks or statements.
      The more these kinds of attacks happen, the higher the risk that the versions will suffer and be negatively impacted in evaluation.
    </li>
    <li>Event quests (flagship events)</li>
    <li>Version cover art</li>
    <li>Choice of banners</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If certain people want to continue down the path of 3.x and 4.x,
    then they should not be surprised when their choices are reflected in the final evaluation of Natlan's versions.
