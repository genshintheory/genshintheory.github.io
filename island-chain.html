<title>Island Chains</title>

  </head>
  
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>


  <p>For the first 3 years of Genshin, Xinyan was the 4 star with the highest base atk (with Albedo, Morax a bit higher).
    In 4.0, Freminet became the first 4 star to break through the 'first island chain'.
  </p>

  <p>Island chains (clusters of characters with same base stat):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1st island chain Albedo, Morax: the alchemist/scientist and his financer</li>
    <li>2nd island chain Mona, Qiqi: standard duo</li>
    <li>3rd island chain Nahida, Ayato</li>
    <li>4th island chain Wriothesley, Klee: standard Lee</li>
    <li>5th island chain Cyno, Lyney: Hamilton duo, political founders</li>
    <li>6th island chain Yoimiya, Keqing: the Qing ladies</li>
    <li>7th island chain Diluc, Ganyu: only after observing Genshin's development for the first 3-4 years 
      does one realize how strong Diluc is canonically in the lore.
      If Ganyu is akin to a minor deity in Liyue, then Diluc's strength is nearly on par with that of gods.
    </li>
    <li>8th island chain Eula, Ayaka: the superhumans of Teyvat, what a cute pair, literally stronger than archons (Raiden)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As a rule of thumb, generally speaking once you start reaching Tartaglia's level in strength do you begin to have 'high' attack (above 300).
    The range between Childe and Alhaitham can be called 'high'.
    The range between Cyno/Lyney to Scaramouche can be called 'pretty high'.
    And things around Diluc/Ganyu level and above are 'very high' and on the level of gods/deities.
  </p><p>
    If there is anything the year of Sumeru showed, it is that being placed above Diluc/Ganyu is a privilege, not a right.
    Gone are the days of Inazuma where literally every new character was higher than Diluc/Ganyu (Eula, Ayaka, Raiden, Yae).
    On the other hand, Sumeru did see some novel revolutions in the hp dimension with Dehya and Nilou.
  </p>

  <p>There are some analogies in Star Rail if you standardize the base stats. 
    HSR has 4 base stats: ATK, HP, DEF, and Speed.
    For ATK specifically:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Jing Yuan-Lunae appear to be at Cyno-Lyney level when you standardize the stats</li>
    <li>Clara is around Keqing level</li>
    <li>Luocha-Himeko is around Diluc-Ganyu level</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For a healer to have such high ATK is actually quite an insult to all dps units in Star Rail.
    As such, Genshin is a more children-friendly game.
    Honkai is not children-friendly and needs to be subject to scrutiny and regulation.
  </p><p>
    What the above means is that currently (as of September 2023), no Star Rail character (except maybe Seele) is canonically stronger than Diluc in the lore.
    So the Star Rail characters are overall weaker than Genshin characters.
    Put another way, the Raiden Shogun of Genshin is stronger than all Star Rail characters (except Seele, given Star Rail has the 4th dimension of speed).
    And that makes some sense, considering the person who is directing Star Rail.
    So Star Rail is what you get if the Raiden Shogun decided to create a video game.
  </p>
  <p>Clara starts with 100 ATK, so viewing these as exam scores, Dan Heng's score is below 100.
    This also suggests that Clara, Keqing, Yoimiya start with a 'standard' / 'middle' value of stat for dps characters.
  </p><p>
    Mr. Yang appears to be around Morax's level.
    The trailblazer of HSR seems to have much higher stats compared to the traveler in Genshin.
    The trailblazer in Star Rail is also more useful.
  </p>
  <p>Cyno/Jing Yuan need room and opportunity for career growth and progression.</p>
