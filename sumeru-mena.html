<title>Sumeru MENA</title>

  <p>MENA refers to the Middle East and North Africa.
    Sumeru appears to take influences from this region of the world as well, besides India.
    When looking at the Mediterranean Sea region, there is a separation of Europe to the north of the sea
    and the deserts of North Africa to the south of the sea.
    Some of this mirrors the separation of Fontaine and Sumeru by water.
    And indeed it can be said that Mediterranean is where these two regions meet.
    So the history of MENA will involve the intertwined histories of both the Fontaine and Sumeru regions.

  <h2>Egypt</h2>
  <p>Egypt (埃及) is one of the oldest civilizations in the world and has one of the oldest writing systems in history:
    the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, the origin for many modern writing systems in the west.
    The ancient Egyptians were famous for building pyramids like those at Giza.
    They also made use of the Nile river for farming and agriculture.
    The ancient rulers were known as pharoahs.
    And many ancient Egyptian deities and beings such as the anubis play an influential role in the design of certain Genshin characters (such as Cyno).
  </p><p>
    Around 2500 years ago, Alexander of Macedon (Basileus) conquered Egypt and Persia, establishing Greek influence in the region.
    To this day, the city Alexandria in Egypt is named after him.
    After him, the Roman Empire conquered Egypt and much of MENA (Ptolemaic Egypt).
    The stories of Cleopatra and Cesar originate from this time period.
  </p>
  <p>
    Near the end of the Mongol empire, the Turks rose from the ashes of the Ilkhanate.
    The Ottoman Turks would take over Anatolia and rule over Egypt and much of the MENA region for several centuries.
  </p><p>
    During the 'Scramble for Africa', various European empires colonized much of the continent.
    This ultimately led to the implosion of the Ottoman empire.
    Specifically, the British and French started interfering in the affairs of the Ottoman Turks with the Crimean war, the Greek war of independence, etc.
    Around 1854, the Suez Canal started construction after a French delegate made an agreement with Sa'id Pasha, Ottoman governor of Egypt.
  </p>
  <p>In 1882, the British empire established rule over Egypt, defeating the Khedive Tewfik Pasha (Khedive of Egypt and Sudan).
    This led to the end of Ottoman rule in Egypt.
    The British army was led by Beauchamp Seymour, 1st Baron Alcester.
    And thus Queen Alexandrina became 'empress of Egypt' as well.
  </p><p>
    Khedive is a Persian title used for sultans and rulers of the Ottoman empire.
    Khedive is also the name of a Genshin NPC that appears in the Chasm (2.6, 2.7).
