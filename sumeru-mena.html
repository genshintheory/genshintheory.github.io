  <h2>Egypt</h2>
  <p>
    Near the end of the Mongol empire, the Turks rose from the ashes of the Ilkhanate.
    The Ottoman Turks would take over Anatolia and rule over Egypt and much of the MENA region for several centuries.
  </p>
  <p>In 1882, the British empire established rule over Egypt, defeating the Khedive Tewfik Pasha (Khedive of Egypt and Sudan).
    This led to the end of Ottoman rule in Egypt.
    The British army was led by Beauchamp Seymour, 1st Baron Alcester.

    Khedive is a Persian title used for sultans and rulers of the Ottoman empire.
    Khedive is also the name of a Genshin NPC that appears in the Chasm (2.6, 2.7).
