  <h2>Egypt</h2>
  <p>Egypt (埃及) is one of the oldest civilizations in the world and has one of the oldest writing systems in history:
    the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, the origin for many modern writing systems in the west.
    The ancient Egyptians were famous for building pyramids like those at Giza.
    They also made use of the Nile river for farming and agriculture.
    The ancient rulers were known as pharoahs.
    And many ancient Egyptian deities and beings such as the anubis play an influential role in the design of certain Genshin characters (such as Cyno).

    Near the end of the Mongol empire, the Turks rose from the ashes of the Ilkhanate.
    The Ottoman Turks would take over Anatolia and rule over Egypt and much of the MENA region for several centuries.
  </p>
  <p>In 1882, the British empire established rule over Egypt, defeating the Khedive Tewfik Pasha (Khedive of Egypt and Sudan).
    This led to the end of Ottoman rule in Egypt.
    The British army was led by Beauchamp Seymour, 1st Baron Alcester.

    Khedive is a Persian title used for sultans and rulers of the Ottoman empire.
    Khedive is also the name of a Genshin NPC that appears in the Chasm (2.6, 2.7).
