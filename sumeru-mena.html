<title>Sumeru MENA</title>

  </head>
  
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>


  <p>MENA refers to the Middle East and North Africa.
    Sumeru appears to take influences from this region of the world as well, besides India.
    When looking at the Mediterranean Sea region, there is a separation of Europe to the north of the sea
    and the deserts of North Africa to the south of the sea.
    Some of this mirrors the separation of Fontaine and Sumeru by water.
    And indeed it can be said that Mediterranean is where these two regions meet.
    So the history of MENA will involve the intertwined histories of both the Fontaine and Sumeru regions.
  </p>


  <h1>Egypt</h1>
  <h2>Ancient history</h2>
  <p>Egypt (埃及) is one of the oldest civilizations in the world and has one of the oldest writing systems in history:
    the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, the origin for many modern writing systems in the west.
    The ancient Egyptians were famous for building pyramids like those at Giza.
    They also made use of the Nile river for farming and agriculture.
    The ancient rulers were known as pharoahs.
    And many ancient Egyptian deities and beings such as the anubis play an influential role in the design of certain Genshin characters (such as Cyno).
    Egyptian mythology (along with Sumer mythology) would become the fountainhead of much of western mythology (such as Greek and Roman mythology).
  </p><p>
    It is believed that the 'indigenous' people of Europe (Basque, Etruscan) originated from North Africa
    before nomadic steppe people from the east invaded the continent.
  </p><p>
    The Phoenicians were another naval civilization that ruled the Mediterranean.
    They were a Semitic people (like the Arabs and Egyptians), and they appear in Egyptian historical records.
    The Phoenicians were predecessors of the Greeks and Romans and influenced the development of the Greek and Roman culture and writing.
  </p>

  <h2>Greek-Roman rule (Fontaine)</h2>
  <p>
    Around 2500 years ago, Alexander of Macedon (Basileus) conquered Egypt and Persia, establishing Greek influence in the region.
    To this day, the city Alexandria in Egypt is named after him.
    After him, the Roman Empire conquered Egypt and much of MENA (Ptolemaic Egypt).
    The stories of Cleopatra and Cesar originate from this time period.
  </p><p>
    The Greek and Roman rule of the MENA region can be interpreted as one of the early historical cases
    of when 'Fontaine' nations ruled over parts of 'Sumeru'.
    The myths and legends of the Roman nymph Furina (and Egeria/Aegeria) are from this time period.
    Genshin does seem to support the idea of the hydro archon being involved in the history of Sumeru
    such as when the previous hydro archon (lord of Amrita) died and gets buried in the Sumeru desert (Vourukasha Oasis and Gaokerena).
  </p>

  <p>The Roman empire collapsed due to the Hun/Xiongnu/Germanic invasions.
    Franks, Goths, and other Germanic/Alan/Hunnic people invaded and ruled kingdoms in North Africa.
    Supposedly the modern nation of France derives its name from the Germanic Frankish people.
    Indeed, the modern French language is descended from Latin but contains influences from Germanic languages.
    And thus began the post-Roman chapter of Fontaine history, where figures such as Charlemagne and Chlothar and kingdoms such as the HRE appear.
    These Frankish dynasties would ultimately play an important role in founding several royal houses across Europe
    that would eventually lead to the European age of imperialism.
  </p>

  <h2>Arab, Turkic, Ottoman rule</h2>
  <p>
    After the Romans, the Arabs rose to power and established caliphates in Egypt and the MENA region, leading to the golden age of Islam.
    As for Europe, it would essentially enter a warring states period and would not achieve the unity of the Roman empire for another 1000 years.
    In MENA specifically, the Arabs and Islamic empires were the successors of the Romans.
  </p><p>
    The Muslims conquered the Iberian peninsula and ruled over it for 1000 years as Al-Andalus.
    Only after the Spain drove out the Muslims (reconquista and inquisition)
    does Christopher Columbus take the stage and 'discover' the Americas in 1492.
    But Al-Andalus represents an instance where 'Sumeru' conquered parts of Europe.
  </p>

  <p>Eventually, more Turks (Gokturks) from Tang China started settling in the MENA region.
    During the Mongol empire (which conquered West Asia), the Mamluk Turks rose to power and ruled Egypt.
  </p>
  <p>
    Near the end of the Mongol empire, the Turks rose from the ashes of the Ilkhanate.
    The Ottoman Turks would take over Anatolia and rule over Egypt, Greece, the Balkans, 
    and much of the MENA region for several centuries.
    Osman I founded the Ottoman empire.
    It can be observed that the Ottoman influence still lingers to this day in the Balkan / East Europe region.
  </p>

  <h2>Modern European imperialism ('return of Fontaine')</h2>
  <p>
    During the 'Scramble for Africa', various European empires colonized much of the continent.
    This ultimately led to the implosion of the Ottoman empire.
    Specifically, the British and French started interfering in the affairs of the Ottoman Turks with the Crimean war, the Greek war of independence, etc.
    Around 1854, the Suez Canal started construction after a French delegate made an agreement with Sa'id Pasha, Ottoman governor of Egypt.
  </p>
  <p>In 1882, the British empire established rule over Egypt, defeating the Khedive Tewfik Pasha (Khedive of Egypt and Sudan).
    This led to the end of Ottoman rule in Egypt.
    The British army was led by Beauchamp Seymour, 1st Baron Alcester.
    And thus Queen Alexandrina became 'empress of Egypt' as well.
  </p><p>
    Khedive is a Persian title used for sultans and rulers of the Ottoman empire.
    Khedive is also the name of a Genshin NPC that appears in the Chasm (2.6, 2.7).
  </p>

  <p>While Britain did colonize much of Africa, it was not the only European power to do so.
    France also colonized much of Africa, resulting in many modern African nations using French as an official language.
    And this can almost be seen in the Girdle of Sands, where one tunnel of the desert leading to Fontaine is given a French name: Chemin Oublie (Forgotten Path).
    If the Greeks and Romans represent an early instance of Fontaine involvement in the Sumeru region,
    then the British and French empires represent the next instance where Fontaine ruled over parts of Sumeru (during the Alexandrina era).
  </p><p>
    During the Alexandrina era of the British empire, <i>The Rhodes Colossus</i> cartoon was published,
    depicting Cecil Rhodes standing across Africa from Cape Town (South Africa) to Cairo (Egypt).
    This represented the British rule over a continguous swath and north to south corridor of Africa.
    Indeed, at the time there were talks about building a railway connecting the two ends of the continent (proposed by Edwin Arnold).
  </p><p>
    Cecil Rhodes (塞西尔·罗兹) was a Brit who ruled over South Africa during the Alexandrina era.
    The 'Rhodes scholarship' is named after him.
    So whoever is behind awarding the Rhodes scholarship may want to pay attention to how Genshin treats Cyno, Cecil, etc.
