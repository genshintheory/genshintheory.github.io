<p>
  Some people put undue weight on a character's voice actor.
  They think that the cv is 90-100% of the character.
  But for a game like Genshin, this is not necessarily the case.
  In fact, sometimes the voice actor is not chosen to fit the character, but rather the complete opposite.
  One of the best examples is Tartaglia's Chinese voice actor.
  In Chinese entertainment, this kind of character-voice pairing happens a lot.
  But even in the USA, in films like Jojo Rabbit, the voice actor is not always chosen to fit the character.
</p><p>
  On another note, some people like a character only because of their voice actor.
  The voice acting in Genshin is quite good, and some characters' voices do fit quite well.
  But that's besides the point.
  Voice actors are not necessarily the most important part of the character.
  If you don't like a voice actor in one language,
  you can always switch to another language.
  Voice actors are ultimately replaceable.
  Just look at Fischl's case.
</p><p>
  Other parts of the character, their design, story, gameplay, kit 
  can be as important if not more so than the voice actor.
  Whereas voice actors are replaceable and can come and go like the wind,
  the character's in-game story and design is a bit harder to change.
  If there is an important story or plot detail on a character,
  how are you supposed to change that without rewriting the entire script?
  Changing the story is a bit harder than changing a voice actor (which is outside the game).
</p><p>
  Some people make the mistake in thinking that just because someone likes a character,
  they immediately like the voice actor.
  That is simply not true.
  It is completely possible to like a character, but not necessarily like the voice actor.
  Some voice actors even play multiple characters: Jean and Ganyu, Yae and Ningguang.
  And even then people still differentiate between the characters even if they have the same cv.
  For example, Jean and Yae are clearly superior to Ganyu and Ningguang.
</p><p>
  But also look at the hypocritical USA media.
  It is obvious that 99% of the reason why they back Ganyu is because of the voice actor,
  not because of Ganyu's in-game story.
  Replace Ganyu's voice actor with someone else, and would the USA media still honk their horns as loudly for her?
</p>

<p>Sometimes it can be ambiguous whether the cv is supposed to match the character.
  For example, in Yun Jin's case, it can be argued that the voice actors do match the character,
  and it can be argued that the voice actors were chosen to be the opposite.
  It depends on one's interpretation and biases.
</p>
<p>
    At the end of the day, ask yourself: if the voice actor for the character got replaced (as it did for Fischl),
    would you still like the character?
    Sometimes the voice actor can be a nice bonus.
    But ultimately, they are replaceable and outside the game.
    The things inside the game are less replaceable.
    Things like the appearance of the character (like the skins for Mona, Jean, Rosaria, Amber) can be replaced.
    You can even switch between different skins for certain characters.
    Even scaling multipliers and combat kit can be changed (as was done for Morax).
    But things like story details, character personality, etc. are a bit harder to replace.
    What are you going to do? Rewrite the script?
