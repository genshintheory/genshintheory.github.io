<h2>千朵玫瑰</h2>
<p>Version 3.0 will introduce the <a href='sumeru.html'>Sumeru</a> region and dendro element.
  The people Sumeru strangely do not have dreams.
  As the nation of knowledge, the fanciful things that appear in dreams seem to be the antithesis to rationality.
</p>

<h2>Archon quest</h2>
<p>In part 1 we enter the forests of Sumeru and meet Collei and Haypasia.
  The traveler then has a hallucination or dream encountering the Irminsul and Aranara fungi people.
  We learn that Collei is infected with Eleazar but that when she was experimented on by Dottore, 
  the symptoms of the disease seemed to disappear.
</p><p>
  We then enter Sumeru City and meet Dehya, Dunyarzad, and Nilou.
  Dehya is Dunyarzad's bodyguard, and Nilou is about to prepare the Sabzeruz festival.
  In the city we learn about the Akasha terminal but are unable to ascertain information about the dendro archon.
</p><p>
  We travel to Ormos and meet Alhaitham and the Emerites
  in time to see Alhaitham teach Tariq a lesson.
  We learn about the divine capsule.
</p><p>
  In part 2, we return to Sumeru City in time for the Sabzeru Festival, but it is canceled.
  Whereas Nilou and others are dedicated to the current dendro archon (Lesser Lord Kusanali),
  some people of the Akademiya seem to still worship the Greater Lord Rukkhadevata (who perished in the archon war).
  We learn that Dunyarzad also has Eleazar and will one day succumb to the disease too.
</p><p>  
  The traveler then experiences deja vu and meets a young girl named Nahida.
  It is a groundhog day experience.
  Nahida explains that the world runs in a loop cycle called samsara (轮回).
  We also learn that the knowledge capsule and Akasha are powered by the gnosis of the goddess of wisdom.
  Dehya also compares Sumeru to a giant brain that people are connected to via the Akasha terminals.
  In this way people can pool their collective knowledge.
  Nahida says it's an apt analogy.
</p><p>
  They take off their Akasha terminals and then suddenly remember everything,
  seemingly breaking out of the loop.
  Nahida says that if the people are like lab rats in an experiment, then Nahida is the moon.
</p><p>
  Eventually the Traveler and Paimon discover that it is not that the people of Sumeru do not dream
  but that the Akademiya is harvesting their dreams via the Akasha terminal.
  They separate their consciousness and place it inside a huge collective dream.
  The deja vu that the traveler experiences is tied to how people often forget what they dreamed about.
  And so people are placed in a perpetual samsara dream cycle,
  with their dreams being harvested constantly by the Akademiya.
  The Traveler, Paimon, and Nahida were all in this huge collective dream of the Sabzeruz festival.
  The task is now to find the person who is the host of the dream.
</p><p>
  Soon Dunyarzad's consciousness could not take the dream harvesting any longer and disappears.
  It was too late to save her.
  We also learn that Nahida is in fact the Lesser Lord Kusanali.
</p><p>
  Also even though they are in a dream,
  some things do get preserved.
  For example, Dehya gets better at using her claymore each day
  because even if dreams and memories are forgotten,
  the muscle memory in the sword movements stay with Dehya.
</p><p>
  Traveler and Paimon discover that Nilou is the host of the dream.
  After Nilou performs a dance, the dream samsara ends.
  It turns out that Nahida had saved Dunyarzad.
  Nahida is able to possess the consciousness of anyone wearing the Akasha terminal,
  including the Snezhnayan bionic puppet Katheryne.
</p>
<p>So the truth has been revealed:
  Kathyrene is indeed a puppet of Snezhnaya,
  and if Snezhnaya represents USA hegemony,
  then Kathyrene represents a pawn in the broader USA empire,
  how the USA wants to put a Kathyrene on the board of every Fortune 500 company,
  how they want to use Kathyrene to police the movements of everything everywhere around the world.
</p>


<h2>Tanger and Razi event</h2>
<p>Tanger (丹吉尔) is praised as the best story writer in Ormos Sumeru.
  In the event, we find out he is the father of Razi. Collei also joins our team.
  The Genshin storywriters seem fine criticizing Tanger, 
  but do not seem to have the guts to criticize their stakeholders and other clients backed by the USA empire.
  It is not a surprise that someone named Tang Lu was executed this past summer 2022.
  Perhaps criticizing Tanger is part of the act
  and also to signify that the modern era will not be another Tang dynasty.
  The Tang already had their time to rule.
  Now it is time for another era.
</p><p>
  This raises a question of how to regulate and control the media.
  When the media criticizes a certain group or person,
  if that group does not want to be attacked further or if they want to preempt any attack,
  they need to retaliate or make it known that the cost of criticizing them is not worth it.
  They need to impose a huge penalty on that media organization so that they would not dare attack them again.
  These types of blackmail and bullying tactics are used by the USA empire and their proxies all the time
  against weaklings across the world.
</p><p>
  The philosophy of the USA rule in certain Asian countries like Singapore is narrow-minded.
  They want only the Tang or the Ming (or sometimes the Sui) and otherwise exclude every other dynasty in Chinese history.
  They say if you don't want the Tang then you must have the Sui or Ming and nothing else.
  And this excludes so many other periods in history like the Han, Yuan, and Qing.
  This is the characteristic of USA imperialism: excluding the majority and only caring about their own interest groups.
  Such a narrow minded view only benefits a narrow portion of the population rather than everybody.
  Chinese history is much more than the Tang or Ming.
</p><p>
  The irony is that in Chinese, Tanger is not written with 唐 but rather 丹 as is the case with Niwa (丹羽).
</p>


<h2>Drip (August 22)</h2>
<p>Today Genshin gave three reasons to skip 3.0 entirely:
  Cyno, Nilou, Candace.
  Cyno is electro and appears to be wielding a polearm.
  Nilou is hydro and appears to be a dancer.
  Candace is hydro and appears to be holding a shield.
</p>

<h2>Optimizations</h2>
<p>With dendro, the dendro crystals, dendro dmg goblet, Sumeru books will also be added.
  The alternate sprints/movements of Mona, Yae, Yelan, Sayu, Ayaka, and Fischl will also be optimized.
  The pull effect of various skills and bursts is adjusted so that the vertical range is twice the horizontal range.
  This includes the abilities of Jean, Venti, Sucrose, Kazuha, Traveler, Heizou, and the Viridescent Hunt.
</p><p>
  Given that electro resonance was updated to incorporate dendro reactions,
  one wonders if Mona's C1 would also be updated to include hydro-dendro reactions 
  (like maybe increase bloom, hyperbloom, burgeon dmg by 15%).
</p><p>
  The number of friends increased from 45 to 60.
  Many of the people playing Genshin appear to be FBI or CIA agents in disguise.
  These FBI shills often abuse power to manipulate daily commissions and artifact drops.
  It is unknown why Genshin would allow these FBI agents to have control over such things.
  Like look at what India did in history. 
  Some people just idiotically gave the British control over parts of India,
  and then boom India became a British colony.
  Why on earth would you give the imperialists control over key parts of your game?
  You want to be a USA colony?
</p>

<h2>Banners</h2>
<p>Collei, Diona, Fischl will feature with zhongli and tighnari in the first banner.
  This banner is a complete joke.
  Collei will be given for free in an event.
  And tighnari will join the standard banner.
  Fischl was also given for free in 2.8.
  And by this point almost everybody has Diona.
  There is basically zero pull value.
</p><p>
  The weapon banner is also pure garbage.
  The vortex vanquisher is a mid and underwhelming weapons,
  befitting of how mid and underwhelming tighnari and zhongli are.
</p>

<h2>Location names</h2>
<p>Sumeru will have the following areas: Avidya Forest, Lokapala Jungle, Ardavi Valley, Ashavan Realm, Vissudha Field, Vanarana.
  These sound more like Indian toponymic names.
</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Sumeru will bring many new enemies, creatures, and plants.
  The name Zaytun in Zaytun Peach is related to Arabic (meaning olives الزيتون).
  The Kalpalata is more related to India (referring to a Sanskrit medical work on plants कल्पलता).
  The choice of plants illustrates the dual Mideast and South Asian influences on Sumeru.
</p><p>
  The sumpter beasts look like Tibetan mastiffs.
  Tibet is the region of China that borders South Asia (Nepal, India, etc.).
  So the introduction of such animals illustrates part of the Silk Road trade and connection between China and South Asia.
  Tibet also has a long history of cultural contact with South Asia.
  During the Yuan dynasty of China, the emperors commissioned a Tibetan Buddhist monk to invent a new script called Phagspa
  to transliterate the various languages of the Mongol empire, including Chinese, Mongolian, Sanskrit, Persian, Turkic, etc.
  The design of Phagspa is based on the Brahmic scripts used throughout South and Southeast Asia.
  Moreover, phagspa is thought to have inspired the development of Hangul in Korea.
  Such was the vast influence of the Yuan dynasty.
</p>
<p>In the Arabic language the determiner Al (ال) is often put in front of words.
  It serves a similar grammatical role as the English word 'the'.
  The difference is that 'Al' tends to be used for many more things and is even put in front of people's names:
  for example Alhaitham (الهيثم).
  The determiner is often found in Western European and Semitic languages like Arabic,
  indicating a Mediterranean sprachbund (even if the two language families are separate).
</p>


<h2>Dendrograna</h2>
<p>When doing a charged attack with a dendrograna, the dendrograna will do a coordinated attack.
  RIP to ayato.
  Also compare to the electrograna which does a coordinated attack upon hit (does not have to be CA, can be anything).
  Overall the dendrograna appears to be more exclusive, whereas the electrograna is more inclusive.
  But if it only means excluding ayato, that's not necessarily a bad thing.
</p><p>
  There are withered zones (死域) that reduce all RES and even max HP.
  Many withered zones can be cleared by using a CA with dendrograna.
</p>

<h2>Artifacts</h2>
<p>Two new artifacts Gilded Dreams and Deepwood will release.</p>
<p>Genshin really held back Deepwood. It only shreds 30% res and only for one element.
  Meanwhile, VV shreds 40% res and can do four elements.
  The gain from deepwood is negligible and the name is disgusting.
  It reeks of treason and collusion with the USA FBI.
</p><p>
  In addition the mystic offering system now allows the conversion of more artifact sets,
  including all sets up to v1.2.
  This is a great optimization feature that allows one to convert useless trash blizzard pieces
  into other more useful sets like the hydro or pyro set.
  That way one can exterminate all the useless cryo pieces and make the ganyu and ayaka mains go into extinction.
</p><p>
  Gilded is a unique set that can give the most EM in the game among all artifact combos.
  It can give up to 230 EM.
  It is a very general set and appears to be the new bis for characters such as Yae, etc.
</p>

<h2>New characters</h2>
<p>In terms of new characters and reruns, 3.0 is a complete joke and a very poor start to version 3.
  It caters only to the USA imperialists and gives nothing to anybody else.
  Up to 2.1, the game had a decent track record of being fair to all users in the fanbase.
  But after 2.1, there were more instances of serving the USA empire and their proxies a bit more.
  Now 3.0 is the ultimate manifestation of how unequal capitalism unchecked can get.
</p><p>
  The only new worthwhile character is Collei, who looks a million times better than the dog tighnari and dori.
  Tighnari and Dori are disgusting characters catered to serve that absuive nori who colludes with the FBI to backstab her own people.
  Just like the 2.4 banner choice of pairing zhongli with ganyu,
  or the 2.6 choice of making yoshinori an ancestor of kazuha,
  introducing tighnari and dori into the game in 3.0 is horrible and is among the worst things to happen in the game.
  It is not a show of strength, but a show of weakness and showing that you are a vassal to the USA empire.
  It shows you don't care about art but only about money and profit, which leads to a decay in social environment and culture.
  Tighnari and dori should not exist in the game. Neither should yoshinori or kazuha for that matter after 2.6.
  It is seriously recommended that whoever made such decisions be inspected for discipline and moral integrity.
</p><p>
  They should also make a public apology for mistreating Seigou in 2.6.
  The logic behind some of these decisions is twisted: it is made to enhance the rich and oppress the poor.
  I will promote someone you killed or someone who will kill you, but never promote you.
  You are not allowed to attack anyone, but I am allowed to attack everyone close to you.
  It is made to serve the interests of people in power while hurting those without power.
  Only someone evil would be so low to bully the weak and not the strong.
  When Genshin attacked the strong instead like in 2.1 with executing Rosalyn,
  that was one of the most heroic moves they made.
</p><p>
  Still, here Collei is on the first half and Dori is second half,
  which balances the distribution of new characters,
  which is completely different from the 2.8 decision of putting Heizou, Kazuha, Klee together in 2.8
  and Yoimiya alone in the second half (one of the most unequal decisions in the world).
  It is recommended that the people designing the banners be inspected for discipline and integrity.
  Many of the banners starting in 2.4 and onwards have been extremely unfair and unequal,
  including the 2.4 zhongli banner, 2.6 ayato banner, 2.7 yelan banner (choice of 4 stars), 2.8 kazuha banner.
  This pattern suggests abuse, and abuse should never be tolerated. It needs to stop.
  Treat people fairly or reverse it so that only the USA capitalists are treated unfairly.
  The USA does not operate on a system of fairness or equality.
  If anything their sole objective is to accelerate inequality.
  So why are you trying to play along with that system?
  Is the USA really bribing you with so much money that you would abandon all morales and everybody else?
  In that case you are no different from a colony.
  You attack someone named Seigou but in the end you act no different from the Qing dynasty in its 100 years of humiliation.
  Hypocrisy.
</p><p>
  It seems Genshin learned their lesson in 3.0 from past mistakes in 2.4 and 2.6.
  In 3.0 they now put Zhongli with Tighnari (a gay duet) in the first half and Ganyu with Kokomi in the second half.
  Overall it is a fair decision to put two virgin cucks together while weakening Ganyu with someone who cannot crit.
  The choice of characters indicates that Genshin still pays attention to certian media sites owned and manipulated by the USA.
  From a national security perspective, it poses a risk for a company to be manipulated by foreign media sites and the USA
  and make decisions for their game affecting people worldwide.
</p><p>
  Another key point is that tighnari will enter the standard banner in 3.1.
  This gives tighnari absolutely zero pull value.
  There is no point in pulling tighnari when you will get him anyways by losing 50/50 on the standard.
  This is revenge for the abuses and crimes committed by nori.
  This makes 3.0 an even bigger joke.
</p><p>
  Zhongli and Ganyu were already featured in the 2.4 lantern festival.
  Now Genshin chooses to feature them again in the 3.0 opening patch.
  This is not fair at all to all the other characters in the fanbase.
  It indicates that Genshin puts priority on certain characters over others
  for the sake of profit, which is never a good thing.
  It causes a decay in social environment and loss of trust.
  You want to make money while screwing others? Go take your money.
  But more people will despise you for it.
  The recent decisions has also shown that Genshin has adopted a zero sum mentality,
  just like the USA imperialists, rather than a win-win mentality.
  Zero sum is I win everything you lose everything, my gain is your loss.
  I will make one person win everything and make you lose everything.
  As Genshin seems to continue going down this road, this is very problematic from a security point of view.
  You really need to tell these people to stop. This behavior is not ok. They need to correct for their mistakes.
</p>

<h2>Flaws in story</h2>
<p>There was one disturbing thing about 2.7.
  That is the part where morax saves Xiao.
  This is twisted. If anything Xiao should be saving that old geezer morax.
  The zhongli simps are rapists like Li Hao, and they are backed by even more rapists (the USA empire),
  and now Genshin wants to turn villains into heroes?
  It is recommended that the story team behind Genshin be inspected for discipline and moral integrity.
  These are supposedly the same people who made yoshinori the ancestor of kazuha.
  So 2.6 and 2.7 had two poor decisions back to back.
</p><p>
  Version 2.8 had an even worse decision by making Kazuha look like a hero while beating up Persikov.
  Kazuha can never be a hero if he descends from someone named yoshinori.
  The story team needs to be seriously investigated for these poor decisions
  and being a vassal to the USA empire.
  Version 1.6 had a major flaw for making us fight someone named Jinyou while helping someone named Zhuhan.
  Version 2.4 had us play as Keqing and fight someone named Xiuyong and Xiuxing.
  And in 2.3 they made us fight something called the Golden Wolflord.
</p><p>
  The story writers have a very clear bias, serving the interests of the Ming elite while hurting everyone else,
  and this person named Xiao Luohao (小螺号) seems more like an alias covering their real identity.
  These people are acting more and more like Li Hao. 
</p><p>
  Version 2.1 had a very good storyline: executing Rosalyn and killing Fleein' Lin.
  We need to go back to the good ole' days.
  Make another story where Li Hao goes to jail or we get to fight Li Hao as an enemy.
</p><p>
  Also make nori the enemy that we have to kill.
  Or make Gindi the biological father of tighnari and dori.
  Then the score may just be settled.
  At this point, it is unclear what objective Genshin is trying to fulfill.
  They call themselves Yuanshen, but are acting more like Mingshen,
  a Ming vassal catering to the interests of the USA empire,
  while not having the guts to criticize or eliminate rapists like Li Hao.
  It is almost surprising a game like Genshin is allowed to publish content.
  There is currently nothing benefiting the masses, only benefiting a select few imperialists.
</p>


<h2>On 'free speech' and abuse of media</h2>
<p>The USA has an amendment that 'protects free speech'.
  Let's put it bluntly: the USA does not have free speech at all.
  A lot of media in the USA, including online sites and social media, is owned by capitalists or USA government agents or their proxies.
  They might sometimes laud or champion on how they have 'free speech',
  but the moment someone starts criticizing or attacking their political proxies or things they support,
  they will start to abuse their monopoly power on the media and restrict free speech.
  So it is not really free at all.
</p><p>
  It is similar to the facade of 'democracy' in the USA.
  They may brag and say they are more 'democratic'
  but the moment one starts criticizing their political proxies and objectives,
  they start cracking down and excluding people from the so called 'democracy',
  so it is not really democratic at all,
  but only a system run by people that the elites want to keep in,
  whereas all their enemies are pushed out of that system.
</p><p>
  Behind any media organization there is someone running the scene,
  and in the worst case they abuse their power to manipulate media and public sentiment for their own political objectives.
  Now who will stop them?
</p><p>
  The nature of capitalism is to expand more and more, into foreign markets,
  and eventually brainwash and control people in the foreign markets to do your bidding,
  for the sake of profit.
  This is called imperialism.
  Technically, if all countries have free and open markets that allow the USA businesses to exploit,
  then you are basically inviting the imperialists to your doorstep to control and manipulate your country's media and money.
  Who can stop them?
</p><p>
  The only thing that can stop the imperialists is something stronger than any market force.
  This usually requires a strong consolidated state power,
  and it requires putting the state above the market (rather than market above the state).
  The consolidated state government power needs firm control over the military, police, and state media,
  so they can override whatever local propaganda or media the capitalists or businesses are trying to push.
  If you do not have a strong state power, you basically become a colony.
  Colonies fail to protect their own citizens from being brainwashed and controlled by foreign influence.
</p><p>
  When a media organization repeatedly abuses its power and pushes the same propaganda
  for the sake of annoying or attacking others, they pose a threat to the social community.
  How do you deal with this?
  They need to stop what they are doing.
  Either tell them to stop, give a severe punishment to correct their behavior,
  or in the most extreme scenarios if necessary remove the people from power
  or even dismantle and destroy the organization entirely.
</p><p>
  The irony is that the USA often pursues such an approach in foreign policy.
  If the USA does not like a particular government or organization, wherever anywhere in the world,
  they will try to initiate 'color revolutions' to overthrow the regime.
  Only when a country is strong enough itself (has a strong centralized government, military, economy)
  can it resist the USA's attacks and color revolution schemes.
  Otherwise it is very easy to crumble and fall apart.
</p>


<h2>Design of anti-shield enemies: if China is a shield, then the USA is like a shadowy husk, forming its own shield</h2>
<p>The above discussion ties in with Genshin's anti-shield enemies, one of the most important features added in the game.
  If Liyue is the nation of the shield, with their archon Morax symbolizing a shield that protects things from attacks,
  that is an inherently defensive policy in nature.
  There is a huge stereotype that China has been defensive for most of its history.
  However, the Han dynasty's conquest of the Xiongnu and western regions,
  the Tang dynasty's conquest of the Gokturks,
  the Yuan dynasty's large scale conquests of Eurasia,
  and the Qing dynasty's conquests
  all point to a very different aspect of Chinese history:
  one that is more offensive in nature.
</p><p>
  If you want to be a virgin cuckold or a eunuch,
  you get something like the Ming dynasty or Song dynasty,
  both of which completely failed to expand north or west like the Han, Tang, Yuan, or Qing dynasties.
  The Ming and Song were completely defensive in nature, and maybe the Liyue archon symbolizes that.
  Liyue symbolizes a much smaller, weaker, more defensive type of China.
  And there are some idiots that may even celebrate that.
  Because when China is smaller it is more easy to oppress people inside it and try to maintain your rule,
  which is what the Ming dynasty did.
  To maintain a large empire requires significantly more skill.
  And the Ming emperors completely lacked talent and ambition to govern a large country,
  so they crawled into their little shells and opted for a smaller country.
  The Ming failed to defeat the Mongols to the north and west,
  so the Ming focused more on executing their own people instead.
  It is similar to that guy named Mingbo in Yelan's story quest.
  Mingbo lacked ambition and could not even articulate himself properly, and he gets angry easily,
  whereas that other candidate Qian (乾) was more of a chad, posting his successful trading operations publicly.
</p><p>
  And this is where anti shield enemies come in.
  If you are a cuck that celebrates the shield and blocking all damage,
  how do you deal with enemies that are anti-shield?
  Things like corrosive rifthounds that bleed through shields 
  or the shadowy husks that create their own shields against shielded enemies
  are examples of anti-shield enemies.
  And if Liyue represents China and the land of the shield,
  then anti-shield enemies sort of represent what the USA can do.
  The USA oftentimes forms their own shields, by restricting free speech, restricting the media, 
  cracking down on their own citizens, restricting democracy, to prevent people from participating,
  even restricting their own markets.
  The USA is like the black serpent knight or shadowy husk, forming their own shields or obtaining buffs when dealing with shielded opponents.
  And this poses a fundamental issue to people who only have a defensive mindset.
  It becomes harder to defeat your opponent if you only have a shield.
</p><p>
  People who use Zhongli need to learn how to deal with opponents that are anti-shielded to begin with.
  Otherwise you are raising a generation of incompetent eunuchs who have no idea how to deal with things like the USA,
  which can form its own shield to counter your shield.
  But there are idiots who are fine with that: they would rather have a weak and small country like the Ming
  so they can focus more on killing each other and their internal enemies rather than dealing with an external threat.
  The Qing existed for a reason: a big reason was to kill off the idiots running the Ming dynasty.
  That is one of the greatest gifts the Qing gave to China, besides many other things the Qing did.
</p><p>
  At the height of their power, the Han, Tang, Yuan, and Qing dynasties could directly influence the politics of surrounding vassal states.
  They could even destroy and rearrange entire nations and kingdoms, in all directions north, south, east, and west.
  That is called true power or superpower status (similar to what the USA hegemon is like today).
  The Ming is a complete virgin by comparison. They could not even defeat the Northern Yuan.
  The Ming could not destroy anything so they killed their own people instead.
