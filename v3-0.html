<h2>On 'free speech' and abuse of media</h2>
<p>The USA has an amendment that 'protects free speech'.
  Let's put it bluntly: the USA does not have free speech at all.
  A lot of media in the USA, including online sites and social media, is owned by capitalists or USA government agents or their proxies.
  They might sometimes laud or champion on how they have 'free speech',
  but the moment someone starts criticizing or attacking their political proxies or things they support,
  they will start to abuse their monopoly power on the media and restrict free speech.
  So it is not really free at all.
</p><p>
  It is similar to the facade of 'democracy' in the USA.
  They may brag and say they are more 'democratic'
  but the moment one starts criticizing their political proxies and objectives,
  they start cracking down and excluding people from the so called 'democracy',
  so it is not really democratic at all,
  but only a system run by people that the elites want to keep in,
  whereas all their enemies are pushed out of that system.
</p><p>
  Behind any media organization there is someone running the scene,
  and in the worst case they abuse their power to manipulate media and public sentiment for their own political objectives.
  Now who will stop them?
</p><p>
  The nature of capitalism is to expand more and more, into foreign markets,
  and eventually brainwash and control people in the foreign markets to do your bidding,
  for the sake of profit.
  This is called imperialism.
  Technically, if all countries have free and open markets that allow the USA businesses to exploit,
  then you are basically inviting the imperialists to your doorstep to control and manipulate your country's media and money.
  Who can stop them?
</p><p>
  The only thing that can stop the imperialists is something stronger than any market force.
  This usually requires a strong consolidated state power,
  and it requires putting the state above the market (rather than market above the state).
  The consolidated state government power needs firm control over the military, police, and state media,
  so they can override whatever local propaganda or media the capitalists or businesses are trying to push.
  If you do not have a strong state power, you basically become a colony.
  Colonies fail to protect their own citizens from being brainwashed and controlled by foreign influence.
</p><p>
  When a media organization repeatedly abuses its power and pushes the same propaganda
  for the sake of annoying or attacking others, they pose a threat to the social community.
  How do you deal with this?
  They need to stop what they are doing.
  Either tell them to stop, give a severe punishment to correct their behavior,
  or in the most extreme scenarios if necessary remove the people from power
  or even dismantle and destroy the organization entirely.
</p><p>
  The irony is that the USA often pursues such an approach in foreign policy.
  If the USA does not like a particular government or organization, wherever anywhere in the world,
  they will try to initiate 'color revolutions' to overthrow the regime.
  Only when a country is strong enough itself (has a strong centralized government, military, economy)
  can it resist the USA's attacks and color revolution schemes.
  Otherwise it is very easy to crumble and fall apart.
</p>


<h2>Design of anti-shield enemies: if China is a shield, then the USA is like a shadowy husk, forming its own shield</h2>
<p>The above discussion ties in with Genshin's anti-shield enemies, one of the most important features added in the game.
  If Liyue is the nation of the shield, with their archon Morax symbolizing a shield that protects things from attacks,
  that is an inherently defensive policy in nature.
  There is a huge stereotype that China has been defensive for most of its history.
  However, the Han dynasty's conquest of the Xiongnu and western regions,
  the Tang dynasty's conquest of the Gokturks,
  the Yuan dynasty's large scale conquests of Eurasia,
  and the Qing dynasty's conquests
  all point to a very different aspect of Chinese history:
  one that is more offensive in nature.
</p><p>
  If you want to be a virgin cuckold or a eunuch,
  you get something like the Ming dynasty or Song dynasty,
  both of which completely failed to expand north or west like the Han, Tang, Yuan, or Qing dynasties.
  The Ming and Song were completely defensive in nature, and maybe the Liyue archon symbolizes that.
  Liyue symbolizes a much smaller, weaker, more defensive type of China.
  And there are some idiots that may even celebrate that.
  Because when China is smaller it is more easy to oppress people inside it and try to maintain your rule,
  which is what the Ming dynasty did.
  To maintain a large empire requires significantly more skill.
  And the Ming emperors completely lacked talent and ambition to govern a large country,
  so they crawled into their little shells and opted for a smaller country.
  The Ming failed to defeat the Mongols to the north and west,
  so the Ming focused more on executing their own people instead.
  It is similar to that guy named Mingbo in Yelan's story quest.
  Mingbo lacked ambition and could not even articulate himself properly, and he gets angry easily,
  whereas that other candidate Qian was more of a chad, posting his successful trading operations publicly.
</p><p>
  And this is where anti shield enemies come in.
  If you are a cuck that celebrates the shield and blocking all damage,
  how do you deal with enemies that are anti-shield?
  Things like corrosive rifthounds that bleed through shields 
  or the shadowy husks that create their own shields against shielded enemies
  are examples of anti-shield enemies.
  And if Liyue represents China and the land of the shield,
  then anti-shield enemies sort of represent what the USA can do.
  The USA oftentimes forms their own shields, by restricting free speech, restricting the media, 
  cracking down on their own citizens, restricting democracy, to prevent people from participating,
  even restricting their own markets.
  The USA is like the black serpent knight or shadowy husk, forming their own shields or obtaining buffs when dealing with shielded opponents.
  And this poses a fundamental issue to people who only have a defensive mindset.
  It becomes harder to defeat your opponent if you only have a shield.
</p><p>
  People who use Zhongli need to learn how to deal with opponents that are anti-shielded to begin with.
  Otherwise you are raising a generation of incompetent eunuchs who have no idea how to deal with things like the USA,
  which can form its own shield to counter your shield.
  But there are idiots who are fine with that: they would rather have a weak and small country like the Ming
  so they can focus more on killing each other and their internal enemies rather than dealing with an external threat.
  The Qing existed for a reason: a big reason was to kill off the idiots running the Ming dynasty.
  That is one of the greatest gifts the Qing gave to China, besides many other things the Qing did.
</p><p>
  At the height of their power, the Han, Tang, Yuan, and Qing dynasties could directly influence the politics of surrounding vassal states.
  They could even destroy and rearrange entire nations and kingdoms, in all directions north, south, east, and west.
  That is called true power or superpower status (similar to what the USA hegemon is like today).
  The Ming is a complete virgin by comparison. They could not even defeat the Northern Yuan.
