  <p>The sp shows some more images of Fontaine and the traveler swimming underwater.
  </p>

  <p>Phase 2 features kokomi, who was recently fired from her job.
    Barbara has always existed in the game as an off-field healer, 
    and Fontaine will bring more hydro units, including hydro traveler and hydro archon.
    For hyperbloom, Barbara is good enough as hyperbloom does not really require special hydro app.
    Hyperbloom has essentially made hydro more egalitarian.
    Units such as Yelan, XQ no longer have the same competitive edge compared to other units like Barbara.

  <p>The person deciding the banners has clear bias and favoritism for every version between 2.8 to 3.8,
    trying to put all the rarer characters on one side compared to other,
    trying to accelerate and exacerbate inequality.
    This is called laissez-faire capitalism and is the reason why the USA is perhaps the most unequal country in the world.
    The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.

  <h2>Veluriyam Mirage</h2>
  <p>This is translated as 琉形蜃境 liuxing shennjing in Chinese.
    Veluriya is Sanskrit for lapis lazuli.
    In previous years, the summer version took place in Golden Apple Archipelago.
  </p><p>
    The mirage is found in a genie lamp in the Sumeru desert.
    We join Eula, Collei, Kokomi, Klee on an adventure through the mirage.
    Eula finds her lost cousin Lessig Lawrence.
  </p><p>
    Hydro eidolons (droplet creatures) appear in the mirage.
    The mirage also features 2d 'mario puzzles' involving being projected on a screen.
