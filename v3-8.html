  <p>The sp shows some more images of Fontaine and the traveler swimming underwater.
  </p>

  <h2>Banners</h2>
  <p>Phase 2 features kokomi, who was recently fired from her job.
    Barbara has always existed in the game as an off-field healer, 
    and Fontaine will bring more hydro units, including hydro traveler and hydro archon.
    For hyperbloom, Barbara is good enough as hyperbloom does not really require special hydro app.
    Hyperbloom has essentially made hydro more egalitarian.
    Units such as Yelan, XQ no longer have the same competitive edge compared to other units like Barbara.
  </p>
  <p>The person deciding the banners has clear bias and favoritism for every version between 2.8 to 3.8,
    trying to put all the rarer characters on one side compared to other,
    trying to accelerate and exacerbate inequality.
    This is called laissez-faire capitalism and is the reason why the USA is perhaps the most unequal country in the world.
    The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
  </p>

  <p>Mika and Eula:
    How good is Mika for Eula? Is he the best Eula support?
    Mika c6 is definitely a great Eula support for giving 60% physical crit damage, perhaps even the best.
    In fact Mika c6 is almost close to a universal support as most characters can do physical damage (besides catalysts).
    Without c6, Mika is still a good support for giving an atk speed buff, which allows Eula to gain more stacks on her burst,
    besides increasing her NA dps.
  </p><p>
    Rosaria is another very good support for Eula, giving crit rate and physical res shred at c6.
    Eula benefits from cryo res via crit rate buff, and Eula does like to crit on her nuke.
  </p>


  <h2>Veluriyam Mirage</h2>
  <p>This is translated as 琉形蜃境 liuxing shennjing in Chinese.
    Veluriya is Sanskrit for lapis lazuli.
    In previous years, the summer version took place in Golden Apple Archipelago.
  </p>
  <p>
    The mirage is found in a genie lamp in the Sumeru desert.
    We join Eula, Collei, Kokomi, Klee on an adventure through the mirage.
    Eula finds her lost cousin Lessig Lawrence.
    Collei compares Eula to an ice cube, describing how elegantly Eula dances.
  </p><p>
    Klee brings the traveler to the mirage using a letter from her mom Alice.
    Kokomi also visits the mirage for therapy after getting fired from her job.
  </p><p>
    We act through a script created by director Zosimos.
    It is cast on a 2d projector screen.
    The player has to interact with various props like stars and thickets to progress through the play.
    According to Idiya, the story is inspired by a tale from 1000 nights.
    Zosimos is also the creator of the new Kaeya and Klee skins.
  </p><p>
    The part where the player has to act on a stage is reminiscent to the beginning of FF9 in the castle.
    There are some paper mario games that also feature acting on stage.
    Kaeya plays as the Dagger Bandit.    
  </p>

  <p>
    Hydro eidolons (floating droplet cyclops creatures) appear in the mirage.
    As Rhodeia of Loch says, the nature of water is to take any shape.
    The eidolons indeed can transform and shapeshift into many different things.
  </p><p>
    The mirage also features 2d 'mario puzzles' involving being projected on a screen.
    The music sounds like something you would hear at a circus.
  </p><p>
    The barking fox challenge is like the Sorush challenge of 3.8.
  </p>

  <p>There is a camera setup referencing 'Journey to the East'.</p>

  <p>Rewards for the event include Layla and Kaeya's pirate skin.</p>
