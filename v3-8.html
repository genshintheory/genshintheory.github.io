  <p>The sp shows some more images of Fontaine and the traveler swimming underwater.

  <p>Phase 2 features kokomi, who was recently fired from her job.
    Barbara has always existed in the game as an off-field healer, 
    and Fontaine will bring more hydro units, including hydro traveler and hydro archon.
    For hyperbloom, Barbara is good enough as hyperbloom does not really require special hydro app.
    Hyperbloom has essentially made hydro more egalitarian.
    Units such as Yelan, XQ no longer have the same competitive edge compared to other units like Barbara.
