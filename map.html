  <p>In 4.0, a teleport waypoint was introduced in the Sumeru desert near the Romaritime Harbor of Fontaine.
    This brings up the question of what the Genshin experience will look like for new players in the future.
  </p><p>
    Inazuma characters may be the hardest to level up given that Inazuma is isolated from the rest of the continent.
    The player needs to complete the Mondstadt and Liyue arcs before they can reach the Inazuma islands
    to get Inazuma boss drops and materials.
  </p><p>
    By contrast, given that Sumeru and Fontaine are connected to the continent, 
    a new player can explore Sumeru and Fontaine more easily in the early game
    to level up Sumeru and Fontaine characters.
  </p>

  <p>Luckily, 4.2 introduced a new feature where new players can challenge weekly bosses without having to complete the corresponding AQ.
    And thus it becomes a bit easier to farm for characters regardless of region.
    However, one still has to reach the Inazuma AQ to access the Inazuma regular bosses (like pyro hypo, thunderbird, etc.).
