<title>Imbibitor Lunae</title>

  <p>Imbibitor Lunae (饮月), meaning Moondrinker.
  </p>
  <p>It has been noticed that the Dan (丹) in Dan Heng's name has a certain connection to a certain corporation,
    similar to how Svarog contains the 史 character.
    This corporation recently fired hu for abuse of power, unprofessionalism, slander, libel, defamation.
    That is truly a heroic move.

  <h2>Lunae in Genshin</h2>
  <p>Genshin does not have sp, but the E does have cd.
    Lunae can have a 3-step E, similar to Diluc or Nilou.
    He can use his E once, twice, or three times.
    If he uses his E once and then does 2 NA, he will enter stance 1 and do one high single target damage, and his E will go on 4s cd.
    If he uses his E twice (either 2 E + NA or E + NA + E), he will enter stance 2 and do one instance of aoe blast damage, and his E will go on 8s cd.
    If he uses his E three times, he will enter stance 3 and do one instance of high aoe blast damage, and his E will go on 12s cd.
    Essentially each E use extends the cd of the stance by 4s.
    The more E he uses, the more powerful the attack will be, but also the longer the cd.
  </p><p>
    His Q will give him 2 stacks of squama and reset his E cd.
    Using his E will consume squama stacks and reduce the cd of the stance by 4s.
  </p>
  


  <p>As of 4.0, the closest analogy for Lunae in Genshin would probably be Alhaitham.
    This is because both characters have a lot of flexibility through their E skill.
    Alhaitham can control how long and how much damage his E mirrors do (3 levels),
    and Lunae can control how much damage his skill can provide (3 levels).
    Alhaitham's burst can provide mirrors, and Lunae's burst can provide stacks.
    So if Lunae is a destruction character because of this flexibility, then Alhaitham should count as a destruction character too.
