  <p>Ayaka is the definition of an overrated unit (but is not as overrated as Ganyu).
    It is a shame that the USA capitalists and their proxies had to wait a year for a downgrade to Kaeya and Qiqi.
    Ayaka's interruption resistance is a joke too and not a funny one either.
    Ayaka as a unit is such a joke that even Cyno would not bother to explain it.
    Ayaka is far from meta, and it is quite sad that she underperforms compared to even four star units.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <h3>Alternate Sprint</h3>
  <p>She has an alternate sprint like Mona except it is clunkier.
    Her sprint can apply Cryo to the enemy and has ICD.
    After using her sprint she gains a brief Cryo infusion.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Normal Attack</h3>
  <p>
    Her normal attack scaling is lower than Kaeya's, which is quite sad actually.
    Her charged attack scaling is realistic but costs stamina.
    However, based on how her charged attacks work, she almost applies Cryo too quickly (and at jagged intervals).
    This basically limits melt Ayaka as sometimes the Pyro supporting character will be melting not Ayaka.
    But Ayaka applies Cryo at jagged intervals and is more limited by ICD, so she is a bit less consistent as an applicator
    then say Childe (who has Riptide which makes his hydro application more uniform and smooth).
    As such, Ayaka is usually run in Freeze teams.
    But not every enemy can be frozen, such as the Maguu Kenki.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Elemental Skill</h3>
  <p>This skill has lower scaling than Xiao's skill, and Xiao gets two charges.
  </p><p>
  Are the USA CIA shills full of Trump supporters?
  What kind of BS are they trying to spread hyping up Ayaka?
  This is called a waste of USA taxpayers' money.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Elemental Burst</h3>
  <p>The burst does around 20 hits and comprises a significant amount of Ayaka's (low) DPS.
    However, it is limited by its high energy cost of 80 and long cooldown of 20 seconds.
    The AoE is also quite small and can miss, sometimes having a mind of its own.
  </p><p>
  Again, her Q applies Cryo too fast so it will usually be the one melting.
  Although it can be used to enable a Pyro carry to melt, Ayaka's burst does not last long enough (only 5 seconds) 
  and is limited by its cooldown, downtime, and high energy cost.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Constellations</h2>
  <p>Very meh and underwhelming. 
    Some of the worst of all 5 stars.
    Ayaka is a very old unit. 
    She is basically an old model of the Tesla, when you want a new model of the Tesla, aka newer units that laughably outperform her.
  </p><p>
  The USA media is very xenophobic.
  If they do not like a character, they will launch a massive smear campaign that attacks and harasses anybody who mains that character.
  If they like a character, they will give them all sorts of compliments and praises even if they are not actually good.
  What kind of idiot is going to delude themselves by these shills...
  </p>
  
  <h2>Build</h2>
  <h3>Artifact Set</h3>
  <p>As mentioned before, since melt Ayaka is limited by her fast but jagged Cryo application and ICD, 
    Ayaka usually wears a 4 piece Blizzard set for Freeze teams.
    Moreover, unlike Ganyu, Ayaka cannot really use the 4 piece Wanderer's Troupe fully (which only activates for bow and catalyst users), 
    which further limits melt Ayaka.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Artifact Stats</h3>
  <p>ATK sands, Cryo DMG goblet, CRIT circlet (usually CRIT DMG since she is usually running 4 piece Blizzard, which already gives CRIT Rate).
    One advantage Ayaka has over Ganyu is that Ayaka has a slightly higher base ATK.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Weapons</h3>
  <p>Her bis the mistsplitter that gives low CRIT DMG is a pretty crappy weapon overall.</p>
  
  <h3>Teams</h3>
  <p>Since she is usually run in Freeze teams,
    she is usually paired with a Hydro unit, another Cryo unit for Cryo resonance, and an Anemo unit for swirl and VV.
  </p><p>
    For hydro, Mona is usually one of her best supports for off field application and DMG Bonus.
    Kokomi can heal but her burst will take field time away from Ayaka (which may not be too bad given Ayaka's low DPS anyways).
    Xingqiu can also work but is usually wanted by Diluc or Hu Tao.
  </p><p>
  The other Cryo unit is usually Shenhe for her buff
  or Diona for the healing, shield, and battery to fund her high burst cost of 80. 
  Rosaria, Kaeya, Chongyun, Qiqi, Aloy can also work.
  The issue with Ganyu is that Ganyu and Ayaka will take away field time from each other,
  and in either case, you would almost always want someone else to do more off field damage, 
  which neither Ganyu nor Ayaka provide that well compared to other supports.
  </p><p>
  But chances are that if you're running either Ganyu or Ayaka as a DPS,
  you would probably want someone who can do way more DPS than them
  like Itto, Raiden, Xiao, or Eula.
  </p><p>
  For the Anemo VV unit, as always Venti, Kazuha, and Sucrose are some of the best choices. 
  Jean can also work if you need the Anemo slot to be a healer.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Calculations</h2>
  <p>We assume level 10 NA and level 10 Q.
    At level 10, her CA spam combo (N1C3) will have a total scaling of around 400% and can be done once every 2 seconds on average
    (also considering the time needed to refresh her infusion by dashing or refresh her stamina).
    So the dps from her CA is roughly
    $$x_c = 1.616*(108.97*3+90.39)/2 = 337.1784$$
    which is lower than Ganyu.
    After using her E, she gets 30% more damage on her NA and CA for 6s which is not much time really and contributes not much to overall dps.
    After using her Q, she also gets 18% DMG Bonus for 10s, but again the contribution is minimal, like a speck of dust.
  </p><p>
  Her burst does around 20 slashes with scaling of around 202% per slash at level 10.
  The burst has cd of 20 seconds, so if she can spam it on cooldown the dps is
  $$x_b \approx 1.616*202*20/20 = 326.432$$
  which is again quite low. But Ayaka has huge energy issues and a large energy cost of 80 so it is unlikely she can spam the burst on cd.
  </p>
  <p>Objectively, of the 2.1 characters, Yoimiya had higher DPS potential than Ayaka.</p>
