<title>Ayaka</title>

  <div id="includedContent"></div>
  

  <p>Kamisato Ayaka (神里绫华 Shenli Linghua), the frostflake heron.
    Argenti makes certain things a bit more obvious,
    as well as that Dahlia character recently introduced.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <h3>Alternate Sprint</h3>
  <p>She has an alternate sprint like Mona except it is clunkier.
    Her sprint can apply Cryo to the enemy and has ICD.
    After using her sprint she gains a brief Cryo infusion.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Normal Attack</h3>
  <p>
    Her normal attack scaling is lower than Kaeya's, which is quite sad actually.
    Her charged attack scaling is realistic but costs stamina.
    However, based on how her charged attacks work, she almost applies Cryo too quickly (and at jagged intervals).
    This basically limits melt Ayaka as sometimes the Pyro supporting character will be melting not Ayaka.
    But Ayaka applies Cryo at jagged intervals and is more limited by ICD, so she is a bit less consistent as an applicator
    then say Childe (who has Riptide which makes his hydro application more uniform and smooth).
    As such, Ayaka is usually run in Freeze teams.
    But not every enemy can be frozen, such as the Maguu Kenki.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Elemental Skill</h3>
  <p>This skill has lower scaling than Xiao's skill, and Xiao gets two charges.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Elemental Burst</h3>
  <p>The burst does around 20 hits and comprises a significant amount of Ayaka's (low) DPS.
    However, it is limited by its high energy cost of 80 and long cooldown of 20 seconds.
    The AoE is also quite small and can miss, sometimes having a mind of its own.
  </p><p>
  Again, her Q applies Cryo too fast so it will usually be the one melting.
  Although it can be used to enable a Pyro carry to melt, Ayaka's burst does not last long enough (only 5 seconds) 
  and is limited by its cooldown, downtime, and high energy cost.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Constellations</h2>
  <p>Noctis C6 is a bit like Ayaka C2.</p>
  
  
  <h2>Build</h2>
  <h3>Artifact Set</h3>
  <p>As mentioned before, since melt Ayaka is limited by her fast but jagged Cryo application and ICD, 
    Ayaka usually wears a 4 piece Blizzard set for Freeze teams.
    Moreover, unlike Ganyu, Ayaka cannot really use the 4 piece Wanderer's Troupe fully (which only activates for bow and catalyst users), 
    which further limits melt Ayaka.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Artifact Stats</h3>
  <p>ATK sands, Cryo DMG goblet, CRIT circlet (usually CRIT DMG since she is usually running 4 piece Blizzard, which already gives CRIT Rate).
    One advantage Ayaka has over Ganyu is that Ayaka has a slightly higher base ATK.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Weapons</h3>
  <p>Her bis is the Mistsplitter. 
    Skyward Blade for ER is fine too.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Teams</h3>
  <p>Since she is usually run in Freeze teams,
    she is usually paired with a Hydro unit, another Cryo unit for Cryo resonance, and an Anemo unit for swirl and VV.
  </p><p>
    For hydro, Mona is usually one of her best supports for off field application and DMG Bonus.
    Kokomi can heal but her burst will take field time away from Ayaka (which may not be too bad given Ayaka's low DPS anyways).
    Xingqiu can also work but is usually wanted by Diluc or Hu Tao.
    Furina can also work.
  </p><p>
  The other Cryo unit is usually Shenhe for her buff
  or Diona for the healing, shield, and battery to fund her high burst cost of 80. 
  Rosaria, Kaeya, Chongyun, Layla, Qiqi, Aloy can also work.
  If paired with Furina, Charlotte can work as a second cryo unit.
  The issue with Ganyu is that Ganyu and Ayaka will take away field time from each other,
  and in either case, you would almost always want someone else to do more off field damage, 
  which neither Ganyu nor Ayaka provide that well compared to other supports.
  </p><p>
  But chances are that if you're running either Ganyu or Ayaka as a DPS,
  you would probably want someone who can do way more DPS than them
  like Itto, Raiden, Xiao, or Eula.
  </p><p>
  For the Anemo VV unit, as always we have Venti, Kazuha, and Sucrose. 
  Jean/Sayu can also work if you need the Anemo slot to be a healer,
  and the may synergize more if doing Ayaka-Furina.
  </p>

  <h3>Wrio, Ayaka, Ganyu</h3>
  <p>As of 4.x, how do these 3 main cryo dps (besides the physical Eula) compare?
    Ayaka is usually best for freeze and burst dps.
    Ganyu is usually best for melt but can do freeze.
    Wrio can do both, but generally Ayaka and Ganyu tend to have more aoe.
    While Wrio can be played freeze, he can shatter the enemy.
    While he can work for melt (especially for nuking CA), his damage is usually split into several parts with icd (Q + NA),
    meaning not all of his hits will melt.
  </p><p>
    Both Wrio/Ayaka can use Yelan/XQ whereas Ganyu is more reliant on Mona/Furina/Kokomi.
    Wrio is more of a destruction class unit whereas the other are more erudition.
    So Wrio can use Marechausse a bit better, while the others prefer Blizzard more.
    Also Wrio can synergize more with Furina's burst.
  </p>

  
  <h2>Calculations</h2>
  <p>We assume level 10 NA and level 10 Q.
    At level 10, her CA spam combo (N1C3) will have a total scaling of around 400% and can be done once every 2 seconds on average
    (also considering the time needed to refresh her infusion by dashing or refresh her stamina).
    So the dps from her CA is roughly
    $$x_c = 1.616*(108.97*3+90.39)/2 = 337.1784$$
    which is lower than Ganyu.
    After using her E, she gets 30% more damage on her NA and CA for 6s which is not much time really and contributes not much to overall dps.
    After using her Q, she also gets 18% DMG Bonus for 10s, but again the contribution is minimal, like a speck of dust.
  </p><p>
    Her burst does around 20 slashes with scaling of around 202% per slash at level 10.
    The burst has cd of 20 seconds, so if she can spam it on cooldown the dps is
    $$x_b \approx 1.616*202*20/20 = 326.432$$
    which is again quite low. But Ayaka has huge energy issues and a large energy cost of 80 so it is unlikely she can spam the burst on cd.
  </p><p>
    Adding ca and burst dps gives
    $$x = x_c + x_b = 663.6104$$
    And that is the power of healthy corporate culture.
  </p>
  <p>But wait as Ayaka is usually played in freeze teams (no Bennett),
    we have to impose a corporate tax and divide the dps by 1.5 (equivalent to a 1/3 or roughly 33% tax).
    The dps is then
    $$x/1.5 = 442.4069333333$$
  </p>


  <p>Objectively of the 2.0 characters, if Ayaka does not have Bennett (or C6 Shenhe) she may do less dps than Yoimiya (with Bennett).
    It will then be kamisatover.
    However if Ayaka has Bennett, then Yoimiya and Ayaka can do comparable dps, but Ayaka will have an advantage in aoe.
    Yoimiya has very high st dps, but we wish it was more aoe.
    Ayaka is a quickswap unit (sprint instant cryo infusion), a bit like Xiaogan.
  </p>


  <h2>Melt versus Freeze</h2>
  <p>Ayaka Melt (with Bennett) has more dps than Ayaka Freeze.
    Bennett gives 1.5 increase in atk (1.5 times more dps).
    Freeze enables blizzard 4p (40% cr on frozen), which paired with cryo resonance (15% cr), which gives 55% cr or 110% cv.
    Assuming a typical well-invested dps has 100% cr and 200% cd,
    then blizzard could allow for 310% cd (stacking crit dmg).
    This is a dps increase of
    4.1/3=1.3666666667.
    In other words, Bennett's buff is greater than 4p Blizzard.
  </p><p>
    So why not both?
    Usually Bennett pyro app may melt frozen enemies.
    But if one is careful to avoid this,
    something like Ayaka-cryo-Bennett-hydro (such as Furina) could work.
    But then there is no vv.
    So then Ayaka-vv-Bennett-Furina.
    This may be Ayaka's highest dps team (on paper).
    A melt Ayaka could be built 2p WT, 2p Blizzard or other kinds of sets.
    Even 4p Emblem is an option for burst nuke.
