<title>Sucrose</title>

  </head>
  
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  <p>Sucrose (砂糖) is better than Kazuha.
    She is a better battery, gives EM without constellations, gives dmg bonus, can use TTDS.
    Her scalings are also quite high, so you can even build damage into her.
  </p><p>
    Sucrose can be used on taser teams, the kokomon team, any team where you would use Venti or Kazuha,
    including national, Childe international, melt, vaporize, etc.
    She is one of the best supports in game.
  </p>

  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>Two of her passives buff EM.
    One increases EM by 50 upon swirl.
    Another increases EM by 20% of Sucrose's EM upon using Sucrose's E or Q.
    This EM buff is absent in Kazuha's kit until C2.
  </p><p>
    If Sucrose has 1000 EM, she can give up to 250 EM to party members at C0.
  </p><p>
    Kazuha has a passive that gives dmg bonus based on his EM.
    Genshin has explained before in 1.6 that one cannot use Sucrose's EM buff to buff Kazuha's dmg bonus buff
    to avoid an infinite spiral.
    (The developers explain that otherwise, if they add an effect that gives EM based on one's dmg bonus,
    then the two effects can be stacked infinitely.)
  </p>

  <h2>Constellations</h2>
  <p>C1 gives extra charge on E, good for battery.
    C2 extends duration of Q by 2s, which is ok.
    C4 is not needed.
    C6 (Chaotic Entropy) gives 20% dmg bonus for absorbed element in Q.
    This dmg bonus buff can match or surpass C0 Kazuha (depending on how Kazuha is built).
  </p>

  <h2>Teams</h2>
  <p>Very versatile, can be used on any team that needs Anemo VV (which is most teams).
    Some highlights include the taser team with sacrificial fragments.
