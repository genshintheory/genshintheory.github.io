  <p>Silver Wolf (银狼) is a punklorde hacker, aether editor, user banner, bubblegum chewer, and stellaron hunter.
    What Silver Wolf does has no equivalent in Genshin: she can implant a weakness into the enemy.
    What this would mean in Genshin is adding an elemental gauge weakness to an enemy's shield or armor.
    So essentially a Fatui pyro shield could now take more gauge damage from say dendro attacks.
    But no character in Genshin can even do that.
  </p>

  <p>Each of her attacks can debuff the enemy, reducing def, atk, or speed.
    Besides implanting a weakness, her skill also shreds res to the particular element by 20%.
    Moreover it will shred all res by an additional ~10%.
    So she takes the role of universal res shredder.
    Lastly, her ultimate will shred def by ~40% (can be leveled up).
  </p>

  <p>Imagine this in Genshin:
    you have a character that shreds res with E (ok maybe Morax), 
    shreds def, atk, speed with each attack (who does this?),
    and then shreds 40% def with Q all at C0.
  </p><p>
    By comparison, Lisa's Q shreds 15% def.
  </p>

  <p>A 40% def shred is around a 1.25 times increase in damage in Genshin.
    This becomes magnified considering Silver Wolf's other attacks can further shred def,
    and her skill can shred res (up to ~30% for a single element and ~10% universal res shred).
    Now 30% res shred is also around a 1.22 times increase in damage.
    So multiply the def shred with res shred, and Silver Wolf can increase damage (for all allies) by more than 1.5 times.
