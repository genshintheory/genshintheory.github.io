  <p>Silver Wolf (银狼), abbreviated SW, is a punklorde hacker, aether editor, user banner, bubblegum chewer, and stellaron hunter.
    What Silver Wolf does has no equivalent in Genshin: she can implant a weakness into the enemy.
    What this would mean in Genshin is adding an elemental gauge weakness to an enemy's shield or armor.
    So essentially a Fatui pyro shield could now take more gauge damage from say dendro attacks.
    But no character in Genshin can even do that.
  </p>

  <p>Each of her attacks can debuff the enemy, reducing def, atk, or speed.
    Besides implanting a weakness, her skill also shreds res to the particular element by 20%.
    Moreover it will shred all res by an additional ~10%.
    So she takes the role of universal res shredder.
    Lastly, her ultimate will shred def by ~40% (can be leveled up).
  </p>

  <p>Imagine this in Genshin:
    you have a character that shreds res with E (ok maybe Morax), 
    shreds def, atk, speed with each attack (who does this?),
    and then shreds 40% def with Q all at C0.
  </p><p>
    By comparison, Lisa's Q shreds 15% def.
  </p>

  <p>A 40% def shred is around a 1.25 times increase in damage in Genshin.
    This becomes magnified considering Silver Wolf's other attacks can further shred def,
    and her skill can shred res (up to ~30% for a single element and ~10% universal res shred).
    Now 30% res shred is also around a 1.22 times increase in damage.
    So multiply the def shred with res shred, and Silver Wolf can increase damage (for all allies) by more than 1.5 times.
    This is comparable to Bennett's buff, meaning Silver Wolf is broken.
  </p><p>
    But it becomes even more broken when you realize that Silver Wolf's buffs are multiplicative with ATK buffs ('orthogonal').
    So say you use Tingyun or Bronya to buff atk.
    Then Silver Wolf would provide an additional 1.5 times multiplier on top of the atk buff.
  </p><p>
    If Silver Wolf exists in Genshin, then you would have another Bennett that could multiply on top of Bennett's buff.
    So you get two 1.5 times universal multipliers for a total of a 2.25 times multiplier to all damage.
    So just by having Bennett and Silver Wolf's replica in Genshin, you can double the damage of most units in the game.
  </p>

  <p>Her technique (which ignores weakness types) is broken.</p>


  <h2>Build</h2>
  <p>For pure support build, one can prioritize effect hit rate and energy generation (to have burst up as much as possible).
    Still Silver Wolf herself can do decent damage so building atk, crit, quantum dmg is ok too if one has enough hit rate.
    Her F2P weapon (from the 1.1 event) is good for providing effect hit rate.
  </p><p>
    For teams, as explained above, SW is a universal buffer so she can fit in any team.
    In fact, she is perhaps more universal than Bennett as her def/res debuffs increase the damage for every character,
    whereas Bennett's atk buff may not affect characters that scale with other things like hp.
  </p><p>
    One team to highlight is the mono-quantum team of SW, Seele, and Qingque.
    In such a team, SW's skill will always implant a quantum weakness,
    so there is no need to bring any other element.
    The team would be complete once a quantum abundance or preservation unit is released.
