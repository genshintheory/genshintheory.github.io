  <p>
    Lisa attended school at the Sumeru Akademiya.
  </p><p>
    In combat, she has three main roles: 
    1) def shred via her passive,
    2) proc superconduct for Eula,
    3) hyperbloom driver.
  </p><p>
    While def shred gives another multiplier in damage,
    the def shred from her passive is not much,
    compared to Raiden c2.
    Also the def shred has high energy cost at 80.
    Regardless, because of the def shred, she has been used in various damage per screenshot showcases,
    including with Xiao, Eula, etc.
  </p><p>
    Lisa has been paired with Eula because of def shred and superconduct.
    Still, the 80 energy cost makes Lisa's Q less convenient than E applicators such as Raiden, Yae, Kuki
    (Lisa's off-field application costs energy whereas other electro characters' off-field application does not).
    To play Lisa as a burst spammer, it would help to stack ER on her (weapon, even sands).
  </p><p>
    Lastly, her role as hyperbloom driver has the advantage of not needing the 80 cost burst.
    Just build full EM on Lisa with gilded, pair Lisa with Nahida and Yelan/XQ, and then play Lisa as an on-field driver.
    And given hyperbloom's high scaling, the team can actually deal damage.
    In all honesty, using Lisa as a hyperbloom driver is probably the best way to play her.
    It does not require her to use her expensive 80 cost burst, it is easy to build (full EM), and it does damage.
    And given that Lisa ascends with EM, it is natural to play her in such reaction teams.
  </p><p>
    Does this make Lisa a top tier hyperbloom driver?
    Many electro characters can do the same thing.
    Yae, another electro catalyst, can also be used as an on-field hyperbloom driver (with full EM, gilded).
    And given that Yae has additional EM scaling built into her kit (E gets dmg bonus from EM),
    Yae can deal more damage as a hyperbloom driver than Lisa (Yae's E will deal additional damage besides hyperbloom).
  </p><p>
    The other characters include Raiden, Qing, and Cyno.
    Raiden and Qing do not have built in EM scaling (like Yae's E or Lisa's ascension stat), 
    but can also be built full EM and used to drive hyperbloom.
    The advantage of Lisa and Yae is that they can use their NA to provide electro app.
    Raiden also provides 'free' electro app via E (and this is actually an off-field ability), while her on-field burst can also proc hyperbloom.
    Qing can achieve electro infusion via E but needs to be on-field.
  </p><p>
    Among on-field hyperbloom drivers, Cyno can deal the most damage.
    Cyno has EM scaling built into his kit (like Yae).
    Cyno's mv and scalings give him the highest dps among electro on-field carries.
    Moreover, Cyno gives himself a 100 EM buff.
    So besides dealing hyperbloom damage, Cyno's own NA and E nukes will also deal additional dps with high scaling 
    (higher than Yae's given Cyno is designed as an on-field carry, whereas Yae is an off-field sub-dps).
    All this makes Cyno the premier on-field hyperbloom driver.
  </p>

  <p>Lisa's hold E can nuke and is sometimes used for screenshot showcases.
    Lisa aggravate is not recommended.
    There are many other characters that do more quicken damage, including Yae, Raiden, Cyno, etc.
