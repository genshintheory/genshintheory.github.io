  <p>
    Lisa attended school at the Sumeru Akademiya.
    In combat, she has three main roles: 
    1) def shred via her passive,
    2) proc superconduct for Eula,
    3) hyperbloom driver.
  </p><p>
    While def shred gives another multiplier in damage,
    the def shred from her passive is not much,
    compared to Raiden c2.
    Also the def shred has high energy cost at 80.
    Regardless, because of the def shred, she has been used in various damage per screenshot showcases,
    including with Xiao, Eula, etc.
  </p><p>
    Lisa has been paired with Eula because of def shred and superconduct.
    Still, the 80 energy cost makes it less convenient E applicators such as Raiden, Yae, Kuki
    (Lisa's off-field application costs energy whereas other electro characters' off-field application does not).
    To play Lisa as a burst spammer, it would help to stack ER on her (weapon, even sands).
  </p><p>
    Lastly, her role as hyperbloom driver has the advantage of not needing the 80 cost burst.
    Just stack EM on Lisa, pair Lisa with Nahida and Yelan/XQ, and then play Lisa as an on-field driver.
    And given hyperbloom's high scaling, the team can actually deal decent dps.
