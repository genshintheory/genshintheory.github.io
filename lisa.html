  <p>
    Lisa attended school at the Sumeru Akademiya.
    In combat, she has three main roles: 
    1) def shred via her passive,
    2) proc superconduct for Eula,
    3) hyperbloom driver.
  </p><p>
    While def shred gives another multiplier in damage,
    the def shred from her passive is not much,
    compared to Raiden c2.
    Also the def shred has high energy cost at 80.
    Regardless, because of the def shred, she has been used in various damage per screenshot showcases,
    including with Xiao, Eula, etc.
