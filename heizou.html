  <p>Shikanoin Heizou illustrates the hypocrisy of USA media quite well.
    When Heizou was first revealed in May 2022, some people in the USA said he looked 'mid'.
    Then after Heizou's voice actors were revealed in the 2.8 livestream,
    do you see these 'mid' comments as much anymore?
    This shows that the USA media, FBI, and elites put a lot of undue weight on the character's voice actor
    when in reality the voice actor is often chosen to be the opposite match for the character.
    This is the case for characters like Tartaglia or Yun Jin.
    This may or may not be the case for Heizou, but that will ultimately depend on his in-game story.

  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>His burst is another example of <a href=scale.html>pseudo-quadratic scaling</a>.
    It only has a limit of up to 4 enemies.
    If there are more than 4 enemies, it is no longer quadratic scaling.
    Ganyu, Ayato are other characters that have this 'fake' quadratic scaling.
    It is only quadratic up to a certain limit, after which it is no longer quadratic (but linear).
    Childe is the only character with real quadratic scaling.
