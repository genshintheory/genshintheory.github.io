<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Talents">Talents</span></h2>
<p>Talent priority is AA >= E > Q.
  As Fontaine introduced characters that gain +3 levels on NA via constellations,
  Yoimiya would benefit from constellations that level her AA and E.
  (Itto would probably benefit from AA + Q. Alhaitham AA + E. Scaramouche AA + E/Q. Ayaka AA + Q. Eula AA + Q. Diluc AA + E.
  Xiao is interesting as it depends on constellation: for < C6 then AA + Q, but for C6 would want E + AA/Q.)
</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Auto-Attack">Auto-Attack</span></h3>
<p>Yoimiya has the highest Normal Attack scalings among all Bow users.
  Yoimiya is a ranged unit that is effective when there are many enemies spread far apart and far away from each other 
  (e.g. Floor 9 of the Version 2.0-2.3 abyss or the Version 2.3 dungeon event).
  She is useful in hunting down Specters.
  Because she auto-attacks, people do not have to worry as much about aiming and missing, as is usually the problem with Ganyu.
</p><p>
  Her charged shot summons 3 kindling arrows that can home in on targets.
  These are more for decoration and party tricks as the bulk of her damage is from auto-attacks.
  </p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Elemental_Skill">Elemental Skill</span></h3>
<p>This is multiplicative with her normal attacks. It is one of the few multiplicative buffs in the game.
  Casting it also deals poise damage, which can pop Mona's bubble and break Electro crystals.
  </p>
  <p>With one of her passives, she gains more Pyro DMG Bonus over time.
  She gains a stack on hit for a max of 10 stacks.
  Each stack gives 2% Pyro DMG Bonus and lasts for 3 seconds.
  </p>
  
  <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Elemental_Burst">Elemental Burst</span></h3>
<p>Marks one enemy with Blaze which does an AoE explosion that can only be triggered by other party members.
  When an enemy marked with the blaze is defeated, it will pass on to a nearby enemy.
  The Blaze explosion becomes more effective when paired with an Anemo vacuum unit like Venti or Kazuha.
  As an explosion, it also deals reasonable blunt type poise damage, which can break shields.
  Note like Xingqiu's burst, Yoimiya's blaze does not snapshot but is instead dynamic.
</p>
  <p>
  With one of her passives, after using her burst, she gives the rest of the team 10-20% more ATK.
  This is basically a free Noblesse or Pyro Resonance buff (note it does not buff herself).
  </p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Constellations">Constellations</span></h2>
<p>
  Her C6 has a 50% chance to fire another arrow that deals 60% of original damage.
  This effectively makes it easier to attain max stacks of pyro dmg bonus from her passive.
  It also increases expected/average dps by around
  $$1/2 + 1.6/2 = 1.3$$
  times. This is a separate multiplier (akin to 50% crit rate, 160% crit damage).
</p>

  <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Build">Build</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Artifacts">Artifacts</span></h3>
<p>Yoimiya has a number of options:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>4 piece EO: for increasing NA damage (released in 2.6 with chasm)</li>
  <li>4 piece Shimenawa: since she does not rely too much on her burst for the bulk of her damage, Shimenawa can help boost her auto-attacks even further</li>
  <li>2 piece Shimenawa, 2 piece Crimson: generalist build</li>
  <li>4 piece Crimson: for reaction based damage</li>
  </ul>
<p>Here 2 piece Shimenawa can be replaced with 2 piece Gladiator for the ATK increase.
</p>
  
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Artifact_Stats">Artifact Stats</span></h3>
<p>Aim for ATK% on the sands, Pyro DMG Bonus on the goblet, and CRIT on the circlet.
</p><p>For substats, CRIT &gt; ATK &gt; ER.
</p>
  
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Weapons">Weapons</span></h3>
<p>Among 5 stars, Thundering Pulse is her best in slot. Skyward Harp is also decent for her.
  Polar Star provides good crit rate, but the other two weapons have more convenient passives for Yoimiya specifically.
  Among 4 stars, the Rust is her best option. The craftable Hamayumi and Prototype Crescent are also ok.
  Using the Compound Bow for physical Yoimiya is a meme but doable since she has high scaling on her autoattacks anyways.
  </p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Teams">Teams</span></h2>
<p>As Yoimiya attacks fast with her NA, when paired with XQ/Yelan/Furina,
  she may not vape all her hits, and instead it might be the hydro subdps vaping. 
  But this is similar to Noctis, who does not vape all his CA hits.
</p><p>
  With Raiden or Chevreuse, her teams may proc the vapeload/overloaded reaction, 
  and overloaded got buffed a bit in Version 1.6.
  Even with the overload buff, it may not make overload her best team.
  Other possible reactions include burgeon with Nahida/hydro.
  She can also try melt, but the game lacks a cryo XQ/Focalors.
  Perhaps Charlotte E is the current option as of 4.3 and maybe Kaeya/Rosaria Q to some extent.
</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Supports">Supports</span></h3>
<ol>
  <li>Yun Jin: one of Yoimiya's best support as Yun Jin's NA buff is quite broken for her</li>
  <li>Bennett: one of her best teammates and healers</li>
  <li>Xingqiu can be used, but since she attacks so fast anyways that often Xingqiu will be the one vaporizing.
    Still XQ can be used more for his off-field sub-dps and dmg reduction.
  </li>
  <li>Yelan: similar with XQ, great with Yoimiya as can provide dmg bonus too</li>
  <li>Focalors: dmg bonus, hydro app</li>
  <li>Candace: can provide dmg bonus</li>
  <li>Raiden Shogun: provides off field electro damage to proc Overloaded. Her 7 second burst can also fill Yoimiya's 7 second downtime.</li>
  <li>Yae: can provide sub-dps for fireworks</li>
  <li>Fischl: similar off field Electro application as Raiden</li>
  <li>Beidou: powerful sub-DPS who can also apply Electro for overload Yoimiya</li>
  <li>Albedo: also provides off field damage for Yoimiya.</li>
</ol>

  <li>Yoimiya can benefit from a shielder like Morax/Diona/Thoma/Layla
    and an Anemo unit like Venti or Kazuha will help Yoimiya even further.
  </li><p>
    As her best teams usually always have Bennett,
    her vv rotation can look like:
    Bennett E/Q, vv shred, hydro subdps E/Q, Yoimiya E, fire away.
  </li>


  <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Example_Teams">Example Teams</span></h3>

<ol>
  <li>Yoimiya-Bennett-XQ/Yelan/Focalors-vv: top 1 or 2 best teams for her damage, vv can be kazuha/Venti</li>
  <li>Yoimiya-XQ/Yelan/Focalors-Bennett-Morax/Yun Jin/Thoma/Diona/Layla</li>
  <li>Yoimiya-Raiden-Yun Jin/Chevreuse/vv-Bennett: Yoimiya-Raiden overload team with last two slots being flex</li>
  <li>Yoimiya-Beidou-Fischl-Bennett ("Neo Fireworks"): in honor of the Childe fireworks team</li>
  <li>Yoimiya-Raiden-Yelan/Xingqiu-Bennett ("Vapeload")</li>
  <li>Yoimiya-Yun Jin-Bennett-Morax ("Yoimiya double geo")</li>
  <li>Yoimiya-Lyney-Thoma/Klee-Bennett: mono pyro</li>
  </ol>

  <p>As Yoimiya provides an ATK buff (giving her some support abilities) and can be used in a quick-swap manner, 
    it is possible to pair her with Xiao, Raiden, XQ, Hu Tao, Tartaglia and function as a kind of sub-DPS/harmony support.
    It is viable in overworld, and people have cleared Abyss with such combos.
    This ATK buff may give her more synergy with XQ than say HP scalers like Yelan,
    but Yelan or Furina give large enough dmg bonus buffs to Yoimiya to offset this.
  </p>

  <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Calculations">Calculations</span></h2>
  <p>Here we assume talent levels 10-10-10. 
    We assume Yoimiya has a Pyro DMG Bonus goblet and is running 4 piece Shimenawa (which gives 50% Damage Bonus),
    so her total DMG Bonus during her skill is at least \(96.6\)%.
    Within the 10s duration of her skill (which has an 18s cd), she can do her whole 7-hit NA combo around 3 times.
    At level 10, the total NA scaling is \(762.27\), which will have a multiplier buff of \(161.74\) from her skill.
    The DPS is then
  </p>
  <dl><dd>\(x = 3*1.966*1.6174*762.27/18 = 403.98 \)</dd></dl>
  <p>This is higher than Ganyu, C6 Xiangling with vape, and Hu Tao without vape.
    From her passive she will have around 6-7 stacks in a given moment considering her 7-hit NA sequence takes ~3 seconds and each stack lasts 3 seconds.
    This will give her around 12-14% extra Pyro DMG Bonus on average.
    With C6 it becomes easier to gain the full 10 stacks for a total of 20% extra Pyro DMG Bonus.
  </p><p>
  To get a fairer comparison with Hu Tao with vape, we would have to consider Yoimiya's DPS with vaporize, overload, or vapeload.
  But without reactions, Yoimiya's NA DPS is already higher than Ganyu and Hu Tao,
  though less than Xiao.
  </p><p>
    If Yoimiya does 21 hits during her E,
    from ICD, suppose she vaporizes 7 of those hits (via Yelan/XQ).
    In reality, we may not know which of the 7 hits gets vaped,
    so let us do an approximation.
    The average scaling for the 7-hit combo is 
    $$z_m = 762.27/7 = 108.9$$
    Suppose equivalently Yoimiya does 21 hits with this avg scaling.
    <!-- do we have reliable cryo applicator? -->
    Then melting 7 of those hits is akin to doing 28 hits with this avg scaling.
    In other words that is a 4/3 or around 33% increase in dps.
    $$4x/3 = 538.64$$
    Vaping 7 of those hits is akin to doing 21+3.5=24.5 hits with avg scaling
    $$24.5x/21 \approx 1.167 x = 471.31$$
  </p>

  <h3>Yun Jin</h3>
  <p>
    As of Version 2.4, Yoimiya got a big buff from Yun Jin, who can increase Yoimiya's damage by around 1.5 times.
    See <a href=yunjin.html>Yun Jin</a> for details.
    The main result is that with Yun Jin, Yoimiya's non-reaction dps can reach
    $$x = 608.3$$
    One example team where Yoimiya can leverage all these buffs plus vape 
    is Yoimiya, Yun Jin, Bennett, Yelan.
  </p>

  <h3>Rust</h3>
  <p>Note an R5 rust gives 80% NA dmg bonus, which will increase the mv above even more.
    An R5 Thundering Pulse can also give 80% NA dmg bonus while also giving 66% crit dmg.
    Let us factor in the 80% dmg bonus into the above calculation:
  </p>
  <dl><dd>\(x = 3*(1.966+.8)*1.6174*762.27/18 = 568.36 \)</dd></dl>
  <p>That increases the dps by more than 1.5 times.
    So having a simple f2p weapon that buffs her damage by a lot
    is one of Yoimiya's great strengths.
  </p><p>
    With vaporize, we multiply the above by 4/3 to get
    $$4x/3 = 757.8$$
    This is actually really high and cements Yoimiya's status as the single-target queen of dps.
  </p>
