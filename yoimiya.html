<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Talents">Talents</span></h2>
<p>Talent priority is AA >= E > Q.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Auto-Attack">Auto-Attack</span></h3>
<p>Yoimiya has the highest Normal Attack scalings among all Bow users.
  Yoimiya is a ranged unit that is effective when there are many enemies spread far apart and far away from each other (e.g. Floor 9 of the Version 2.0-2.3 abyss).
  She is useful in hunting down Specters.
  Because she auto-attacks, people do not have to worry as much about aiming and missing, as is usually the problem with Ganyu.
</p><p>
  Her charged shot summons 3 kindling arrows that can home in on targets.
  These are more for decoration and party tricks as the bulk of her damage is from auto-attacks.
  </p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Elemental_Skill">Elemental Skill</span></h3>
<p>This is multiplicative with her normal attacks. It is one of the few multiplicative buffs in the game.
  Casting it also deals poise damage, which can pop Mona's bubble and break Electro crystals.
  </p><p>With one of her passives, she gains more Pyro DMG Bonus over time.
  </p>
  
  <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Elemental_Burst">Elemental Burst</span></h3>
<p>Marks one enemy with Aurous Blaze which does an AoE explosion that can only be triggered by other party members.
  When an enemy marked with the blaze is defeated, it will pass on to a nearby enemy.
  The Blaze explosion becomes more effective when paired with an Anemo vacuum unit like Venti or Kazuha.
  As an explosion, it also deals reasonable blunt type poise damage, which can break shields.</p>
  <p
  With one of her passives, after using her burst, she gives the rest of the team 10-20% more ATK.
  This is basically a free Noblesse or Pyro Resonance buff (note it does not buff herself).
  </p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Constellations">Constellations</span></h2>

  <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Build">Build</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Artifacts">Artifacts</span></h3>
<p>Yoimiya has a number of options:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>4 piece Shimenawa: since she does not rely too much on her burst for the bulk of her damage, Shimenawa can help boost her auto-attacks even further.</li>
  <li>2 piece Shimenawa, 2 piece Crimson: generalist build</li>
  <li>4 piece Crimson: for reaction based damage</li>
  </ul>
<p>Here 2 piece Shimenawa can be replaced with 2 piece Gladiator for the ATK increase.
</p>
  
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Artifact_Stats">Artifact Stats</span></h3>
<p>Aim for ATK% on the sands, Pyro DMG Bonus on the goblet, and CRIT on the circlet.
</p><p>For substats, CRIT &gt; ATK &gt; ER.
</p>
  
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Weapons">Weapons</span></h3>
<p>Among 5 stars, Thundering Pulse is her best in slot. Skyward Harp is also decent for her.
  Polar Star provides good crit rate, but the other two weapons have more convenient passives for Yoimiya specifically.
  Among 4 stars, the Rust is her best option. The craftable Hamayumi and Prototype Crescent are also ok.
  
  Using the Compound Bow for physical Yoimiya is a meme but doable since she has high scaling on her autoattacks anyways.
  </p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Teams">Teams</span></h2>
<p>Yoimiya is somewhat unique among Pyro DPS units in that she does not rely on Xingqiu or Vaporize too much for her damage.
  One of her better teams uses the overloaded reaction, which got buffed a bit in Version 1.6.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Supports">Supports</span></h3>
  
<ol><li>Raiden Shogun: provides off field electro damage to proc Overloaded. Her 7 second burst can also fill Yoimiya's 7 second downtime.</li>
<li>Fischl: similar off field Electro application as Raiden</li>
<li>Beidou: powerful sub-DPS who can also apply Electro for overload Yoimiya</li>
  <li>Xingqiu can be used, but Yoimiya does not really need him since she attacks so fast anyways that often Xingqiu will be the one vaporizing</li>
<li>Albedo: also provides off field damage for Yoimiya.</li>
  <li>As always, having a healer like Bennett, a shielder like Diona, or an Anemo unit like Venti or Kazuha will help Yoimiya even further.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Example_Teams">Example Teams</span></h3>

<ol><li>Yoimiya-Raiden overload team with last two slots being flex</li>
<li>Yoimiya-Beidou-Fischl-Bennett ("Neo Fireworks")</li>
  </ol>

  <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Calculations">Calculations</span></h2>
<p>Here we assume talent levels 10-10-10. 
  We assume Yoimiya has a Pyro DMG Bonus goblet and is running 4 piece Shimenawa (which gives 50% Damage Bonus).
