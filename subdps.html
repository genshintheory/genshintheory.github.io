    <title>Off field DPS</title>

  </head>
 
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  <p>
    Here we define sub-dps as off field damage.
    Various characters provide off field damage.
    Some proc on NA only like Beidou, XQ.
    Others proc on hit: Raiden E, Albedo.
    Others will automatically hit: Yae, XL, Morax, Fischl, Venti, Kazuha, etc.
    Interestingly, Raiden's burst NA do not proc Beidou's Q but do proc XQ's Q.
  </p><p>
    Of off field damage dealers: Yae, Raiden, Albedo, etc. have 100% uptime.
    Usually for sub-dps there is a limit/'wavelength'/internal cd (not to be confused with the icd from gauge theory) 
    to how frequent the damage is dealt.
    If x damage is dealt per hit, then dps is
    $$z = x \frac{duration}{icd} \frac{1}{\max(cooldown, duration)}$$
    or x times the number of hits within the duration divided by the cooldown of the skill.
    Note if the cooldown is less than the duration (ie 100% uptime) then the above simplifies to x/icd.
  </p><p>
    Of particular interest is the completely automatic team
    where you don't do anything at all and let the sub-dps do all the damage.
    This is referring to a Yae-Fischl-Albedo type team.
    Each of these characters has 100% uptime (or close to it),
    and they provide automatic sub-dps.
    Yae and Fischl automatically hit, and Albedo's E will proc when they hit.
  </p><p>
    The sub-dps from Yae and Albedo is
    $$z = 488.0 + 239.8 = 727.8$$
  </p>

  <h2>Off-field Electro application</h2>
  <p>The main use of electro application is for quicken and quickbloom teams.
    The premier electro sub-dps are Yae, Raiden, and Kuki.
    Each offers their own advantages.
    Yae provides the most off-field damage and has 100% uptime (with 14s duration),
    but the turrets hit single targets and aiming is random.
    Raiden provides 100% uptime (25s duration) and aoe coordinated attack,
    but scaling is lower.
    Kuki provides healing, 100% uptime at C2 (15s duration), 
    and does aoe application centered around the character, but scaling is also low.
  </p><p>
    Fischl is just a worse version of Yae.
  </p><p>
    Each of these electro units is useful in different teams,
    particular with their dendro partner (Alhaitham or Nahida).
    For Alhaitham, he may prefer Yae or Kuki depending on team:
    Alhaitham-Yae-Nahida-Kokomi
    or Alhaitham-Nahida-Kuki-Yelan.
    On the other hand, Nahida's off-field sub-dps synergizes well with Raiden
    in a dendro Rational team.

  <h2>Sub-dps categorization</h2>
  <p>Off field application can be done via E or Q.
    It can be 100% uptime or part time.
  </p><p>
    E sub-dps with 100% uptime (or near 100% uptime):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pyro: Dehya c2 (18/20s) (Guoba does not really count)</li>    
    <li>Dendro: Nahida</li>
    <li>Geo: Albedo</li>
    <li>Electro: Yae, Kuki c2, Raiden</li>
    <li>Cryo: none (lesser extent: Qiqi)</li>
    <li>Hydro: none (lesser extent: Mona, Barbara, Nilou, Kokomi; none really have 100% uptime)</li>
    <li>Anemo: none</li>
  </ul>
  <p>E sub-dps with 100% uptime are usually broken as they offer free elemental application with no energy cost.
    It was only until 3.5 when Dehya released that the game finally got a pyro applicator via E with almost 100% uptime.
  </p>

  <p>Q sub-dps (can be part time)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pyro: Yoimiya, Xiangling</li>    
    <li>Dendro: Collei, Baizhu</li>
    <li>Geo: Gorou</li>
    <li>Electro: none (Dori does not really count)</li>
    <li>Cryo: Rosaria, Kaeya, Ganyu/Layla, Ayaka (too short) (none really reliable for melt, but ok for freeze)</li>
    <li>Hydro: Yelan/Xingqiu (enable vape), Ayato (not enough for consistent vape)</li>
    <li>Anemo: Venti, Sucrose, Kazuha</li>
  </ul>
