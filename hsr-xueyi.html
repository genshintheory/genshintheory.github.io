<title>Xueyi</title>

  <p>Xueyi is a quantum destruction unit and the older sister of Hanya.
  </p><p>
    Her E does a blast.
    Her Q is ST and ignores weakness type when reducing toughness (like SW's technique).
    This makes her Q quite decent.
    Moreover her Q deals more damage the more toughness is depleted.
    At lv10, the boost goes up to 60%.
    That is, for every 30 toughness reduced, she gains 15% bonus, up to 60%.
  </p><p>
    When the team reduces toughness, she gains a stack of karma, up to 8 times.
    For every 30 toughness reduced, she gains 1 stack.
    When she caps out at 8 stacks, she consumes them to launch 3 fua, each dealing st damage to a random enemy.
    These fua do not create stacks.
  </p><p>
    She also gains more dmg scaling off her break effect (so she scales with BE like Ruan Mei).
  </p>

  <p>Question: why is this kit considered destruction?
    She does not really have hp fluctuation (besides e2 healing).
    And she seems different from other non-hp draining units like Lunae.
  </p>


  <h2>Genshin equivalent?</h2>
  <p>It is hard to design a Genshin equivalent of such a character, similar to Silver Wolf.
    In Genshin, not every enemy has a gauge shield.
    If all enemies did have gauge shields, then perhaps the Genshin equivalent would be trivial to create.
  </p><p>
    Instead, we propose a different design.
    For every 1k hp (or 1% hp) damage the teams deals to the enemy, she gains 1 stack of karma.
    If multiple enemies are damaged, the total dmg dealt is counted towards this stack.
    This effect procs say every 1s (if you want clocking).
  </p><p>
    She can stack up to X times (8 or even higher).
    When she reaches X stacks, she consumes them to launch 3 fua (that can proc off-field).
    These fua can be aoe off-field (like Raiden/Kuki) or st auto-targeting (like hyperbloom).
