  <p>Xueyi is a quantum destruction unit.
    She does not really have hp fluctuation (besides e2 healing).
    Her E does a blast.
    Her Q is ST and ignores weakness type when reducing toughness (like SW's technique).
    This makes her Q quite decent.
    Moreover her Q deals more damage the more toughness is depleted.
    At lv10, the boost goes up to 60%.
    That is, for every 30 toughness reduced, she gains 15% bonus, up to 60%.
  </p><p>
    When the team reduces toughness, she gains a stack of karma, up to 8 times.
    For every 30 toughness reduced, she gains 1 stack.
    When she caps out at 8 stacks, she consumes them to launch 3 fua, each dealing st damage to a random enemy.
    These fua do not create stacks.
  </p><p>
    She also gains more dmg scaling off her break effect (so she scales with BE like Ruan Mei).
