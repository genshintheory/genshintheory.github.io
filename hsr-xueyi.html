  <p>Xueyi is a quantum destruction unit and the older sister of Hanya.
  </p><p>
    Erwin Rudolf Josef Alexander Schrödinger (埃尔温·薛定谔)
    is a famous quantum physicist named Xue (薛). 
  </p>


  <h2>Kit</h2>
  <p>
    Her E does a blast.
    Her Q is ST and ignores weakness type when reducing toughness (like SW's technique).
    This makes her Q quite decent.
    Moreover her Q deals more damage the more toughness is depleted.
    At lv10, the boost goes up to 60%.
    That is, for every 30 toughness reduced, she gains 15% bonus, up to 60%.
  </p><p>
    When the team reduces toughness, she gains a stack of karma, up to 8 times.
    For every 30 toughness reduced, she gains 1 stack.
    When she caps out at 8 stacks, she consumes them to launch 3 fua, each dealing st damage to a random enemy.
    These fua do not create stacks.
  </p><p>
    She also gains more dmg scaling off her break effect (so she scales with BE like Ruan Mei).
  </p>

  <p>Question: why is this kit considered destruction?
    She does not really have hp fluctuation (besides e2 healing).
    And she seems different from other non-hp draining units like Lunae.
  </p>

  <p>Some people say she works well with elation in the SU.</p>


  <h2>Genshin equivalent?</h2>
  <p>It is hard to design a Genshin equivalent of such a character, similar to Silver Wolf.
    In Genshin, not every enemy has a gauge shield.
    If all enemies did have gauge shields, then perhaps the Genshin equivalent would be trivial to create.
  </p><p>
    Instead, we propose a different design.
    For every 1k hp (or 1% hp) damage the teams deals to the enemy, she gains 1 stack of karma.
    If multiple enemies are damaged, the total dmg dealt is counted towards for stacks.
    This effect procs say every 1s (if you want clocking).
  </p><p>
    She can stack up to X times (8 or even higher).
    When she reaches X stacks, she consumes them to launch 3 fua (that can proc off-field).
    These fua can be aoe off-field (like Raiden/Kuki) or st auto-targeting (like hyperbloom or Lyney taunt).
  </p><p>
    This can make her an off-field subdps.
    She does more damage the more damage the team deals.
    So it seems she would do better for dps/teams that have more innate mv (like hyperbloom, Xiao, etc.).
  </p><p>
    Her E can give 3 stacks, and her Q can give 6 stacks (like Noctis, making these number up, can change these).
  </p><p>
    One can also add an option to store stacks (like Xiaogan's gunbrella).
    For example, rather than automatically launching fua when 8 stacks are reached,
    one can store extra stacks beyond 8, say up to 24.
    Using CA (or E) can unleash all stacks to deal damage.
    The more stacks unleashed the more damage dealt.
    When 24 stacks are reached, it will automatically launch a fua 
    (or this does not need to be automatic, it can be stored like Xiaogan's shards, this is designer's choice).
