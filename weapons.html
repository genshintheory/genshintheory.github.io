<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Weapon_Tierlist">Weapon Tierlist</span></h2>

Overall:
<ol>
  <li>Staff of Homa: great stats and passive, very good on all polearm users and BiS for many (Hu Tao, even Xiao under 50% HP)</li>
<li>Thundering Pulse: great stats similar to Homa, good on many bow users (Yoimiya, Childe), passive is less simple than the Homa</li>
<li>Skyward Harp, Primordial Jade Spear (tied): solid stats, good on many characters, may not be BiS for every character</li>
  <li>Polar Star: decent stat stick, good for many bow users, but only BiS for Childe 
    (and not significantly better than Thundering Pulse and Skyward Harp for Childe)</li>
  </ol>
<p>Weapons like Stringless, Elegy, Amos are really only good on one specific character, so they do not rank as highly.
</p><p>Currently, the Wolf's Gravestone is the most solid claymore, but its substat is ATK%, 
  and the only 5 star CRIT claymore is the Redhorn, which is not exactly best in slot on many claymore users besides Itto.
</p><p>The Primordial Jade Cutter has great 44% Crit Rate substat (but low base attack), but most sword users are supports and would prefer a different weapon. Moreover, the sword DPS users in the game are underwhelming, making it hard to justify pulling on the Jade Cutter alone.
</p><p>For catalyst weapons, the Widsith and Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds are decent. But based on how most catalysts are supports, oftentimes the best catalyst is the Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers.

  <h2>Best Weapon banners</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Version 1.3 Homa + Wolf's Gravestone: 2 great weapons that work well on basically all characters of the respective weapon type</li>
  <li>Version 2.2 Homa + Elegy: Homa works well on basically all polearm users, and Elegy is one of Venti's best weapons</li>
  <li>Version 1.3 PJWS + Jade Cutter: 2 great weapons that work well on most characters of the respective weapon type</li>
  <li>Version 2.5 Kagura Verity + Jade Cutter: 2 great weapons that work well on some characters of respective weapon types (the pity is that many sword/catalyst users are supports and prefer other weapons). That said, the sacrifical sword and stringless also make the banner overall quite decent.</li>
  <li>Version 2.3 Redhorn + Skyward Harp: 2 good weapons that work on some characters of respective weapon types</li>
  <li>Version 2.0 Thundering Pulse + Skyward Blade: 2 good weapons that work on some characters of respective weapon types</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>On CRIT weapons</h2>
  <p>
    The advantage of crit dmg and crit rate weapons is that they make building dps characters much easier,
    especially if the weapon can give as much or more crit than the respective circlet.
    If one is lacking in ATK, one can usually always use Bennett to make up for it.
    But if one is lacking in crit, there are not too many easy ways to increase crit for everybody
    besides farming better artifacts.
    This is why weapons like Homa, Thundering Pulse (TP), Jade Cutter, Jade Spear, Kagura Verity (and even Widsith)
    are generally seen as valuable.
  </p>
  <p>
    Homa, TP, and Kagura are similar weapons giving 608 base atk and around 66% crit dmg at lv90, making them great stat sticks.
    But TP is not necessarily the 'Homa' of bows, and Kagura is not necessarily the 'Homa' of catalysts.
    The two main reasons are 1) the difference in passives and 2) the more support-nature of current bow and catalyst users.
    First, Homa's passive is quite simple, giving ATK based on HP, and it works for all polearm users and resonates with some specific ones.
    By contrast, TP and Kagura have more situational passives, granting bonuses when more niche criteria are met.
    These passives are not something that every bow or catalyst user meets or benefits much from.
    This goes into the second point that many bow and catalyst users are supports that prefer other weapons.
    Venti generally prefers Elegy or Stringless over TP.
    Many catalyst users find even the TTDS more useful.
    That said, TP and Kagura are still great weapons designed to fit Yoimiya and Yae's kits.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly the Jade Cutter and Redhorn are great stat sticks (though lacking in base atk),
    but many sword users prefer other weapons like sac sword, freedom sworn, cinnabar, or aquila,
    and many claymore users prefer other weapons like gravestone or broken pines.
