<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Weapon_Tierlist">Weapon Tierlist</span></h2>

<p>Overall:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First place is a tie: 
    <ul>
      <li>Xiphos (西福斯): this is currently the best weapon in the game, and it's just a 4 star. 
        The passive (Whisper of Jinn) is broken out of its mind.
        It converts EM to ER% at a good rate, but then goes even further and gives ER% to the rest of the party.
        And then this effect can stack.
        So give one Xiphos sword to each of the four members, and never worry about ER again.
        Xiphos puts many 5 star swords (like kazuha's garbage freedom sworn) to shame.
        Xiphos can turn a garbage character into something useful.
        Xiphos is something for anybody, a sword that truly benefits the people and entire team.
        The weapon was so broken that in beta they even had to nerf it a bit 
        (in beta at r5, 1000 em would give ~100% er and then ~30% er to rest of team, which is simply broken, not just for Raiden teams).
        But even then this weapon stands as a god among weapons.
        Whereas yoshinori and kazuha's transient and ephemeral family went bankrupt after only a few generations (because of bad genes),
        Xiphos and Jinn's status as a god weapon will stand the test of time.
      </li>
    <li>Staff of Homa: great stats and passive, very good on all polearm users and BiS for many (Hu Tao, even Xiao under 50% HP)</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
<li>Thundering Pulse: great stats similar to Homa, good on many bow users (Yoimiya, Childe), passive is less simple than the Homa</li>
<li>Skyward Harp, Primordial Jade Spear (tie with Thundering Pulse): solid stats, good on many characters, may not be BiS for every character</li>
  <li>Scarlet Sands: gives 44% crit rate, converts EM to ATK at high rate</li>
  <li>Skyward Spine (tie with Scarlet): gives high base atk, ER, and some cr, versatile and good on many polearm users</li>
<li>Aqua Simulacra: 88% crit dmg, low base attack, good for some bow users, 
  BiS for Yelan and competitive with BiS for other dps bow users (Yoimiya, Childe, etc)</li>
<li>Redhorn (tie with Aqua): 88% crit dmg, low base attack, but BiS really for Itto as does not give as much attack as other claymores</li>
<li>Polar Star: decent stat stick, good for many bow users, but only BiS for Childe 
  (and not significantly better than Thundering Pulse and Skyward Harp for Childe)</li>
  <li>Elegy: gives a ton of ER so as a stat stick it is good on many bow users, 
  gives 100 EM to teammates, with introduction of Sumeru and dendro, EM is playing a more important role</li>
  <li>Stringless: buffs E and Q, gives EM</li>
</ol>

<p>Weapons like Amos, Engulfing, Khaj-Nisut are really only good on one specific character, so they do not rank as highly.
  Honorable mention goes to the Sacrificial weapons as resetting E cd is useful for various characters, including supports.
</p><p>Currently, the Wolf's Gravestone is the most solid claymore, but its substat is ATK%, 
  and the only 5 star CRIT claymore is the Redhorn, which is not exactly best in slot on many claymore users besides Itto.
</p><p>The Primordial Jade Cutter has great 44% Crit Rate substat (but low base attack), but most sword users are supports and would prefer a different weapon. Moreover, the sword DPS users in the game are underwhelming, making it hard to justify pulling on the Jade Cutter alone.
</p><p>For catalyst weapons, the Widsith, Kagura Verity, and Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds are great. 
  But based on how most catalysts are supports, oftentimes the best catalyst is the Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers.
</p><p>
  Freedom-sworn falls behind compared to Xiphos.
  Both give EM, but Xiphos gives ER whereas freedom-sworn only buffs NA/CA/PA and ATK (albeit at a low/marginal rate).
  More characters do not scale with ATK but HP or other stats.
  And various characters depend more on their E and Q damage than AA damage.
  However, ER is something every character can benefit from.

<h2>Best Weapon banners</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Version 1.3 Homa + Wolf's Gravestone: 2 great weapons that work well on basically all characters of the respective weapon type</li>
  <li>Version 1.3 PJWS + Jade Cutter: 2 great weapons that work well on most characters of the respective weapon type</li>
  <li>Version 2.7 PJWS + Aqua Simulacra (tie with 1.3): 2 great weapons that work well on most characters of the respective weapon type</li>
  <li>Version 2.2 Homa + Elegy: Homa works well on basically all polearm users, and Elegy is one of Venti's best weapons</li>
  <li>Version 2.5 Kagura Verity + Jade Cutter: 2 great weapons that work well on some characters of respective weapon types (the pity is that many sword/catalyst users are supports and prefer other weapons). That said, the sacrifical sword and stringless also make the banner overall quite decent.</li>
  <li>Version 2.3 Redhorn + Skyward Harp: 2 good weapons that work on some characters of respective weapon types</li>
  <li>Version 2.0 Thundering Pulse + Skyward Blade: 2 good weapons that work on some characters of respective weapon types</li>
  <li>Version 3.1 Scarlet Sands + Elegy: 2 good weapons that work on some characters of respective weapon types</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>On CRIT weapons</h2>
  <p>
    The advantage of crit dmg and crit rate weapons is that they make building dps characters much easier,
    especially if the weapon can give as much or more crit than the respective circlet.
    If one is lacking in ATK, one can usually always use Bennett to make up for it.
    But if one is lacking in crit, there are not too many easy ways to increase crit for everybody
    besides farming better artifacts.
    This is why weapons like Homa, Thundering Pulse (TP), Jade Cutter, Jade Spear, Kagura Verity (and even Widsith)
    are generally seen as valuable.
  </p>
  <p>
    Homa, TP, and Kagura are similar weapons giving 608 base atk and around 66% crit dmg at lv90, making them great stat sticks.
    But TP is not necessarily the 'Homa' of bows, and Kagura is not necessarily the 'Homa' of catalysts.
    The two main reasons are 1) the difference in passives and 2) the more support-nature of current bow and catalyst users.
    First, Homa's passive is quite simple, giving ATK based on HP, and it works for all polearm users and resonates with some specific ones.
    By contrast, TP and Kagura have more situational passives, granting bonuses when more niche criteria are met.
    These passives are not something that every bow or catalyst user meets or benefits much from.
    This goes into the second point that many bow and catalyst users are supports that prefer other weapons.
    Venti generally prefers Elegy or Stringless over TP.
    Many catalyst users find even the TTDS more useful.
    That said, TP and Kagura are still great weapons designed to fit Yoimiya and Yae's kits.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly the Jade Cutter and Redhorn are great stat sticks (though lacking in base atk),
    but many sword users prefer other weapons like sac sword, freedom sworn, cinnabar, or aquila,
    and many claymore users prefer other weapons like gravestone or broken pines.
