<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Weapon_Tierlist">Weapon Tierlist</span></h2>
<ol><li>Staff of Homa: great stats and passive, very good on all polearm users and BiS for many (Hu Tao, even Xiao under 50% HP)</li>
<li>Thundering Pulse: great stats similar to Homa, good on many bow users (Yoimiya, Childe), passive is less simple than the Homa</li>
<li>Skyward Harp, Primordial Jade Spear (tied): solid stats, good on many characters, may not be BiS for every character</li>
  <li>Polar Star: decent stat stick, good for many bow users, but only BiS for Childe 
    (and not significantly better than Thundering Pulse and Skyward Harp for Childe)</li>
  </ol>
<p>Weapons like Stringless, Elegy, Amos are really only good on one specific character, so they do not rank as highly.
</p><p>Currently, the Wolf's Gravestone is the most solid claymore, but its substat is ATK%, 
  and the only 5 star CRIT claymore is the Redhorn, which is not exactly best in slot on many claymore users besides Itto.
</p><p>The Primordial Jade Cutter has great 44% Crit Rate substat (but low base attack), but most sword users are supports and would prefer a different weapon. Moreover, the sword DPS users in the game are underwhelming, making it hard to justify pulling on the Jade Cutter alone.
</p><p>Most catalysts in the game are underwhelming. The Widsith and Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds are decent. But based on how most catalysts are supports, oftentimes the best catalyst is the Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers.

  <h2>Best Weapon banners</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Version 1.3 Homa + Wolf's Gravestone: 2 great weapons that work well on basically all characters of the respective weapon type</li>
  <li>Version 2.2 Homa + Elegy: Homa works well on basically all polearm users, and Elegy is one of Venti's best weapons</li>
  <li>Version 1.3 PJWS + Jade Cutter: 2 great weapons that work well on most characters of the respective weapon type</li>
  <li>Version 2.5 Kagura Verity + Jade Cutter: 2 great weapons that work well on some characters of respective weapon types (the pity is that many sword/catalyst users are supports and prefer other weapons). That said, the sacrifical sword and stringless also make the banner overall quite decent.</li>
  <li>Version 2.3 Redhorn + Skyward Harp: 2 good weapons that work on some characters of respective weapon types</li>
  <li>Version 2.0 Thundering Pulse + Skyward Blade: 2 good weapons that work on some characters of respective weapon types</li>
  </ol>
