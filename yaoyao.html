  <p>Yaoyao is the first dendro healer in the game
    and has one of the cutest kits in the game with her pet rabbit 
    (celebrating the year of the rabbit in the lunar new year).
  </p>

  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>Her E provides off-field healing and dendro damage through her pet rabbit.
    During her Q, her sprint speed and dendro res is buffed.
    When she jumps she will release more rabbits and healing radishes,
    healing the entire party.
  </p><p>
    Her healing is quite substantial
    (as in she can fully heal all party members with her E and Q).
    Her healing scales with her HP.
  </p>

  <h2>Build</h2>
  <p>
    Her burst costs 80 energy, so she is often used with favonius spear.
  </p><p>
    Deepwood, Clam set (for healing) are viable sets.
    HP-Dendro-Crit (crit rate to proc favonius) is a possible build.
    One can also opt for double or triple hp artifacts if they care more about her healing than damage.
  </p>

  <h2>Teams</h2>
  <p>She can be used on Alhaitham spread/hyperbloom teams, Cyno teams, Nahida teams,
    or any team that needs a healer (such as Xiao).
  </p>

  <h2>Constellations</h2>
  <p>C4 buffs her EM based on her HP, for a max of 120 EM, which is achieved at 40k hp.
    The scaling is .3% of hp is converted to em.
