<h2>Itto</h2>
  <p>Itto, Albedo, Zhongli with -40% Geo RES (-20% from resonance and -20% from Zhongli), 
    ignoring buffs from Gorou from having several Geo party members, 
    ignoring buffs from Zhongli stele resonance, 
    ignoring 15% DMG bonus from Geo resonance on Itto.
    $$(517.7 + 257.8)*1.278 = 991.089$$
    Higher than melt Ganyu.
  </p><p>
    Itto-Raiden-Zhongli. Raiden 7s q fills downtime of Itto's q, while also acting as a battery:
    $$517.7*1.278 + 494.1*1.167 = 1238.2353$$
  </p>

  <h2>Pyro DPS</h2>
  <h3>Diluc</h3>
  <p>VV shred from Anemo unit, ignoring damage done by Anemo unit
    $$(634 + 479)*1.278 = 1422.414$$
  </p>

  <h3>Yoimiya</h3>
  <p>Yoimiya-Yun Jin-Beidou-Bennett
    $$608.3 + 618.8 = 1227.1$$
    Does not factor in overloaded damage.
    Can also try Yoimiya-Beidou-Kazuha-Bennett
    $$(404.0 + 618.8)*1.278 = 1307.1384$$
  </p>

  <h3>Hu Tao</h3>
  <p>We consider Hu Tao-Xingqiu-Thoma-Kazuha for VV shred or else there is no way Hu Tao can compete.
    VV shred from Anemo unit, ignoring damage done by Anemo unit
    $$(435.4 + 479)*1.278 = 1168.6032$$
    But this is really Xingqiu carrying Hu Tao.
    Note using Zhongli will result in less damage (VV shred provides more RES shred than ZL).
  </p>

<h2>Cryo DPS</h2>
  <h3>Eula</h3>
  <p>Eula-Raiden. Superconduct -40% Physical RES for Eula, Raiden's burst during the downtime
    $$494.1+443.8*1.278 = 1061.2764$$
    This is ignoring the additional Phys RES shred from Eula E
    and the burst dmg bonus provided by Raiden's E.
    This is higher than melt Ganyu and similar to Itto, Chongyun national, Childe international.
  </p><p>
    Eula-Beidou. Superconduct -40% Physical RES for Eula
    $$443.8*1.278+618.8 = 1185.9764$$
  </p>

  <h3>Ganyu melt</h3>
  <p>Ganyu teams and Ganyu suck in general. Whoever uses these are bad at making teams.</p>
  <p>Suppose use Zhongli shield. Ganyu melt + Xiangling
    $$(376.5*1.5 + 265)*1.167 = 968.31825$$
    This is inferior to Raiden national and has bigger energy issues.
    There are many holes in this team.
    This essentially gives Ganyu an 80 energy cost ult with Xiangling,
    and funneling energy to XL is painful.
