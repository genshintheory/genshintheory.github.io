  <h2>Quicken teams</h2>
  <p>
    Cyno-Nahida-Yae-Bennett
    $$652 + 582.6 + 617.8 = 1852.4$$
    This is an insanely powerful team.
    This does not factor the EM buff that Nahida can give to Cyno.
  </p><p>
    Cyno-Nahida-Yae-VV
    $$\le (652/1.5 + 617.8)*1.28 + 582.6 = 1929.76$$
    Removing Bennett will also remove the pyro buff from Nahida's q.
    Also having double electro will modify Nahida's q buff for the e.
    Advantage of Anemo VV over Bennett is that it will be easier to proc quicken,
    whereas Bennett's pyro may sometimes remove the quicken status.
    But otherwise, using Bennett or VV does not make much other difference in dps.
    The above calculation suggests that Bennett can be used for the other abyss team,
    thereby freeing up a spot.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nahida-Yae
    $$582.6 + 617.8 = 1200.4$$
    Nahida and Yae do so much sub-dps that the two of them alone can be used as a team together.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alhaitham-Nahida-Yae-Bennett
    $$625 + 582.6 + 617.8 = 1825.4$$
    This does not factor dendro resonance or Nahida EM buff.
  </p>

  <h2>Hyperbloom teams</h2>

  <h3>Cyno hyperbloom</h3>
  <p>
    Cyno-Nahida-Yae-Yelan
    $$652/1.5 + 582.6 + 617.8 + 445.4 = 2080.5$$
    There is no healing or Bennett atk buff, 
    but team relies on the raw sub-dps provided by Nahida, Yae, Yelan.
    This does not factor the dmg bonus that Yelan can provide Cyno.
  </p><p>
    Note the above numbers assume quicken for Cyno, Nahida, Yae.
    But if Yelan is used, in practice there will be less quicken and more hyperbloom.
    A more accurate calculation would use non-quicken dps values for Cyno, Nahida, Yae,
    and add the hyperbloom dps.
    We assume full EM Nahida is used.
    We do not factor the buffs Nahida's Q gives to her E or team.
  </p><p>
    The other question is who is proccing hyperbloom: Cyno or Yae?
    Whose EM should we factor?
    For a lower bound, let's assume that hyperbloom is procced with 100 EM 
    (Cyno gives self 100 EM, Yae can reach 100 EM with Gilded).
    In reality, either can get more than 100 EM, especially if full EM Nahida with Q is used,
    but here we stay on the conservative side.
    From <a href='nilou.html'>Nilou</a>, the hyperbloom damage at 100 EM is 170%.
    An enemy can be damaged by bloom-related reactions at most 4 times per second.
  </p><p>
    The team dps is then
    $$652/1.5 + 243.5 + 488.0 + 445.4 + 4*170 = 2291.6$$
    So hyperbloom damage is so large that it can compensate for lack of quicken.
    More importantly, it compensates for lack of Bennett.
    A way to increase team dps is to give more EM to Cyno and Yae.
    In some teams reaching 1k EM is quite achievable.
    The above also ignores the occassional quicken and EC damage.
    It does not factor possible dendro res shred for Nahida.
  </p><p>
    There are several variants of the above Cyno team:
    Cyno-Nahida-Kuki-Yelan/XQ,
    Cyno-Nahida-Yae/Beidou-Kokomi, etc.
    For Cyno specifically, he really synergizes better with Nahida, Yelan/XQ, and characters that have long-lasting off-field abilities
    to match his 18s on-field time.
    Indeed, Nahida works well with many characters in the game, but arguably the character who needs Nahida the most is Cyno
    (for Cyno specifically, Nahida is almost irreplaceable).
  </p><p>
    Assume that Yae/Kuki have 1k EM and proc all the hyperblooms in the Cyno team.
    We will then ignore their regular damage.
    If there is one enemy, the team dps (Cyno-Nahida-Yae/Kuki-Yelan) is
    $$652/1.5 + 243.5 + 445.4 + 2400 = 3523.6$$
    One could also try 1k EM Cyno with no electro battery,
    but Cyno usually wants an electro partner for his 80 cost burst
    (even though he can sometimes recharge himself).
  </p>


  <h3>Alhaitham hyperbloom</h3>
  <p>Alhaitham-Nahida-Raiden/Kuki/Yae-Yelan.
    Here we only have one electro, and we assume they have 1k EM build 
    (full EM, 4p gilded, EM weapon etc.) to proc hyperbloom.
    As the electro character is built full EM, we will ignore their other sources of damage.
  </p><p>
    Alhaitham non-quicken dps is 330+115.9=445.9 (with Bennett).
    If there is one enemy that gets damaged by the max 4 hyperblooms per second, the team dps is
    $$445.9/1.5 + 243.5 + 445.4 + 2400 = 3386.2$$
    which is ridiculously high, surpassing many c6 units.
    If there are two enemies, dps is 
    $$445.9/1.5 + 243.5 + 445.4 + 2400/2 = 2186.2$$
    which is still top tier.
    If there are three enemies:
    $$445.9/1.5 + 243.5 + 445.4 + 2400/3 = 1786.2$$
    In the limit of infinite enemies, the base damage (from Alhaitham, Nahida, Yelan) is
    $$445.9/1.5 + 243.5 + 445.4 = 1134.8$$
    which itself can be enough to clear abyss (min dps needed is around 500% mv).
    Above the team dps is carried by the hyperbloom reaction (which can contribute half or more of the team dps).
    Hyperbloom dps is technically attributed to the electro driver's EM,
    but it requires a team of three elements to create (dendro, hydro, electro).
    Hyperbloom is an example of a very good reaction.
  </p><p>
    Why Nahida? She provides 100% uptime aoe dendro application via E without energy cost.
    That itself makes her more valuable than most other dendro supports in the game.
    The EM buff from her Q and her high sub-dps (when built for damage) is a bonus.
  </p><p>
    Above we ignored possible dendro res shred from Nahida,
    but an extra 30% dendro res shred would increase this already insane dps even more.
    The dendro res would increase Alhaitham's dps as well as the hyperbloom dps.
  </p>


  <h3>Double hydro hyperbloom</h3>
  <p>Nahida-Yelan-XQ-Raiden/Kuki:
    we assume C6 XQ and ignore effect of C2 res shred.
    For one enemy
    $$243.5 + 445.4 + 415.2 + 2400 = 3504.1$$
    This is top tier because hyperbloom is driving it.
    The double hydro team is a bit less damage than the Alhaitham hyperbloom team
    as Alhaitham contributes a lot of damage.
    So why use double hydro? 
    It can provide the 25% hp buff, XQ can provide damage reduction and extra healing,
    and it makes hydro application easier (with double hydro both Yelan, XQ can spam their bursts on cd more).
  </p><p>
    The advantage of Alhaitham is more dps, dendro resonance giving more EM to team,
    and bonus damage from dendro res shred.
  </p><p>
    The advantage of Cyno (double electro) hyperbloom is potentially even more dps than Alhaitham
    and more energy particles from electro resonance.
    However, Cyno requires more on-field time, whereas Alhaitham can be more flexible and played as a quickswap.
    Moreover, in double electro teams, one should build EM on both electro units in case hyperbloom is triggered by either electro unit.
    By contrast, in double dendro or double hydro where there is one electro unit, it is easy to stack 1k EM on that single electro driver.
  </p>

  <p>The general observation is that hyperbloom teams are superior to pure quicken teams for 1 or even 2 enemies.
    But when there 3 or more enemies, quicken and hyperbloom teams becomes comparable, with quicken even being a bit better
    due to the single-target nature of hyperbloom (sublinear aoe scaling).
  </p>


<h2>Itto</h2>
  <p>Itto, Albedo, Zhongli with -40% Geo RES (-20% from resonance and -20% from Zhongli), 
    ignoring buffs from Gorou from having several Geo party members, 
    ignoring buffs from Zhongli stele resonance, 
    ignoring 15% DMG bonus from Geo resonance on Itto.
    $$(517.7 + 257.8)*1.278 = 991.089$$
    Higher than melt Ganyu.
  </p><p>
    Itto-Raiden-Zhongli. Raiden 7s q fills downtime of Itto's q, while also acting as a battery:
    $$517.7*1.278 + 494.1*1.167 = 1238.2353$$
  </p>

  <h2>Pyro DPS</h2>
  <h3>Diluc</h3>
  <p>VV shred from Anemo unit, ignoring damage done by Anemo unit.
    C0 Yelan
    $$(634 + 445.4 + 59.67)*1.278 = 1455.7$$
  </p>

  <h3>Yoimiya</h3>
  <p>Yoimiya-Yun Jin-Beidou-Bennett
    $$608.3 + 618.8 = 1227.1$$
    Does not factor in overloaded damage.
    Can also try Yoimiya-Beidou-Kazuha-Bennett
    $$(404.0 + 618.8)*1.278 = 1307.1384$$
  </p>

  <h3>Hu Tao</h3>
  <p>We consider Hu Tao-Yelan-Thoma-Kazuha for VV shred or else there is no way Hu Tao can compete.
    VV shred from Anemo unit, ignoring damage done by Anemo unit
    $$(435.4 + 445.4)*1.278 = 1125.6624$$
    But this is really Yelan/Xingqiu carrying Hu Tao.
    Note using Zhongli will result in less damage (VV shred provides more RES shred than ZL).
  </p>

<h2>Cryo DPS</h2>
  <h3>Eula</h3>
  <p>Eula-Raiden. Superconduct -40% Physical RES for Eula, Raiden's burst during the downtime
    $$494.1+443.8*1.278 = 1061.2764$$
    This is ignoring the additional Phys RES shred from Eula E
    and the burst dmg bonus provided by Raiden's E.
    This is higher than melt Ganyu and similar to Itto, Chongyun national, Childe international.
  </p><p>
    Eula-Beidou. Superconduct -40% Physical RES for Eula
    $$443.8*1.278+618.8 = 1185.9764$$
  </p>

  <h3>Ganyu melt</h3>
  <p>Ganyu teams and Ganyu suck in general. Whoever uses these are bad at making teams.</p>
  <p>Suppose use Zhongli shield. Ganyu melt + Xiangling
    $$(376.5*1.5 + 265)*1.167 = 968.31825$$
    This is inferior to Raiden national and has bigger energy issues.
    There are many holes in this team.
    This essentially gives Ganyu an 80 energy cost ult with Xiangling,
    and funneling energy to XL is painful.
  </p>

  <h3>Morgana</h3>
  <p>
    Ganyu freeze is inferior to Ganyu melt.
    The only good things about Morgana are Mona and Venti.
    But they are more efficiently used on other teams.
  </p><p>
    Morgana does not have Bennett, so it gets taxed by a factor of 1.5.
    The team dps is
    $$(376.52 + 340.68 + 314.9/2 + 300)/1.5 = 783.1$$
    With vv shred
    $$((376.52 + 340.68 + 314.9/2)*1.278 + 300)/1.5 = 945.2018$$
    This ignores 60% dmg bonus from Mona on Ganyu and Venti (but is included in Mona's burst).
  </p>


  <h2>National teams</h2>
  <p>See <a href='national.html'>national</a></p>

  <h2>Taser</h2>
  <p>Sucrose-Beidou-Xingqiu-Bennett
    $$618.8 + 479 = 1097.8$$
    Ignoring reaction damage from swirl, EC.
    Without Bennett divide by 1.5.
    To compensate, the reaction damage needs to be quite high (build EM on Sucrose).
    Also without Bennett, and using say Fischl instead, the team will lose a healer.
    There is also a Qiqi variant.
  </p>

  <h2>Fireworks</h2>
  <p>Beidou-Childe with vv shred
    $$(618.8 + 269.84)*1.278 = 1135.68192$$
  </p>
