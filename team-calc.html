  <h2>Quicken teams</h2>
  <p>
    Cyno-Nahida-Yae-Bennett
    $$652 + 582.6 + 617.8 = 1852.4$$
    This is an insanely powerful team.
    This does no factor the EM buff that Nahida can give to Cyno.
  </p><p>
    Cyno-Nahida-Yae-VV
    $$\le (652/1.5 + 617.8)*1.28 + 582.6 = 1929.76$$
    Removing Bennett will also remove the pyro buff from Nahida's q.
    Also having double electro will modify Nahida's q buff for the e.
    Advantage of Anemo VV over Bennett is that it will be easier to proc quicken,
    whereas Bennett's pyro may sometimes remove the quicken status.
    But otherwise, using Bennett or VV does not make much other difference in dps.
    The above calculation suggests that Bennett can be used for the other abyss team,
    thereby freeing up a spot.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nahida-Yae
    $$582.6 + 617.8 = 1200.4$$
    Nahida and Yae do so much sub-dps that the two of them alone can be used as a team together.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cyno-Nahida-Yae-Yelan
    $$652/1.5 + 582.6 + 617.8 + 445.4 = 2080.5$$
    There is no healing or Bennett atk buff, 
    but team relies on the raw sub-dps provided by Nahida, Yae, Yelan.
    This does not factor the dmg bonus that Yelan can provide Cyno.
  </p>


<h2>Itto</h2>
  <p>Itto, Albedo, Zhongli with -40% Geo RES (-20% from resonance and -20% from Zhongli), 
    ignoring buffs from Gorou from having several Geo party members, 
    ignoring buffs from Zhongli stele resonance, 
    ignoring 15% DMG bonus from Geo resonance on Itto.
    $$(517.7 + 257.8)*1.278 = 991.089$$
    Higher than melt Ganyu.
  </p><p>
    Itto-Raiden-Zhongli. Raiden 7s q fills downtime of Itto's q, while also acting as a battery:
    $$517.7*1.278 + 494.1*1.167 = 1238.2353$$
  </p>

  <h2>Pyro DPS</h2>
  <h3>Diluc</h3>
  <p>VV shred from Anemo unit, ignoring damage done by Anemo unit.
    C0 Yelan
    $$(634 + 445.4 + 59.67)*1.278 = 1455.7$$
  </p>

  <h3>Yoimiya</h3>
  <p>Yoimiya-Yun Jin-Beidou-Bennett
    $$608.3 + 618.8 = 1227.1$$
    Does not factor in overloaded damage.
    Can also try Yoimiya-Beidou-Kazuha-Bennett
    $$(404.0 + 618.8)*1.278 = 1307.1384$$
  </p>

  <h3>Hu Tao</h3>
  <p>We consider Hu Tao-Yelan-Thoma-Kazuha for VV shred or else there is no way Hu Tao can compete.
    VV shred from Anemo unit, ignoring damage done by Anemo unit
    $$(435.4 + 445.4)*1.278 = 1125.6624$$
    But this is really Yelan/Xingqiu carrying Hu Tao.
    Note using Zhongli will result in less damage (VV shred provides more RES shred than ZL).
  </p>

<h2>Cryo DPS</h2>
  <h3>Eula</h3>
  <p>Eula-Raiden. Superconduct -40% Physical RES for Eula, Raiden's burst during the downtime
    $$494.1+443.8*1.278 = 1061.2764$$
    This is ignoring the additional Phys RES shred from Eula E
    and the burst dmg bonus provided by Raiden's E.
    This is higher than melt Ganyu and similar to Itto, Chongyun national, Childe international.
  </p><p>
    Eula-Beidou. Superconduct -40% Physical RES for Eula
    $$443.8*1.278+618.8 = 1185.9764$$
  </p>

  <h3>Ganyu melt</h3>
  <p>Ganyu teams and Ganyu suck in general. Whoever uses these are bad at making teams.</p>
  <p>Suppose use Zhongli shield. Ganyu melt + Xiangling
    $$(376.5*1.5 + 265)*1.167 = 968.31825$$
    This is inferior to Raiden national and has bigger energy issues.
    There are many holes in this team.
    This essentially gives Ganyu an 80 energy cost ult with Xiangling,
    and funneling energy to XL is painful.
  </p>

  <h3>Morgana</h3>
  <p>
    Ganyu freeze is inferior to Ganyu melt.
    The only good things about Morgana are Mona and Venti.
    But they are more efficiently used on other teams.
  </p><p>
    Morgana does not have Bennett, so it gets taxed by a factor of 1.5.
    The team dps is
    $$(376.52 + 340.68 + 314.9/2 + 300)/1.5 = 783.1$$
    With vv shred
    $$((376.52 + 340.68 + 314.9/2)*1.278 + 300)/1.5 = 945.2018$$
    This ignores 60% dmg bonus from Mona on Ganyu and Venti (but is included in Mona's burst).
  </p>


  <h2>National teams</h2>
  <p>See <a href='national.html'>national</a></p>

  <h2>Taser</h2>
  <p>Sucrose-Beidou-Xingqiu-Bennett
    $$618.8 + 479 = 1097.8$$
    Ignoring reaction damage from swirl, EC.
    Without Bennett divide by 1.5.
    To compensate, the reaction damage needs to be quite high (build EM on Sucrose).
    Also without Bennett, and using say Fischl instead, the team will lose a healer.
    There is also a Qiqi variant.
  </p>

  <h2>Fireworks</h2>
  <p>Beidou-Childe with vv shred
    $$(618.8 + 269.84)*1.278 = 1135.68192$$
  </p>
