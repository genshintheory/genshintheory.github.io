  <h2>Quicken teams</h2>
  <p>
    Cyno-Nahida-Yae-Bennett
    $$652 + 582.6 + 617.8 = 1852.4$$
    This is an insanely powerful team.
    This does not factor the EM buff that Nahida can give to Cyno.
  </p><p>
    Cyno-Nahida-Yae-VV
    $$\le (652/1.5 + 617.8)*1.28 + 582.6 = 1929.76$$
    Removing Bennett will also remove the pyro buff from Nahida's q.
    Also having double electro will modify Nahida's q buff for the e.
    Advantage of Anemo VV over Bennett is that it will be easier to proc quicken,
    whereas Bennett's pyro may sometimes remove the quicken status.
    But otherwise, using Bennett or VV does not make much other difference in dps.
    The above calculation suggests that Bennett can be used for the other abyss team,
    thereby freeing up a spot.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nahida-Yae
    $$582.6 + 617.8 = 1200.4$$
    Nahida and Yae do so much sub-dps that the two of them alone can be used as a team together.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alhaitham-Nahida-Yae-Bennett
    $$625 + 582.6 + 617.8 = 1825.4$$
    This does not factor dendro resonance or Nahida EM buff.
  </p>

  <h2>Hyperbloom teams</h2>

  <h3>Cyno hyperbloom</h3>
  <p>
    Cyno-Nahida-Yae-Yelan
    $$652/1.5 + 582.6 + 617.8 + 445.4 = 2080.5$$
    There is no healing or Bennett atk buff, 
    but team relies on the raw sub-dps provided by Nahida, Yae, Yelan.
    This does not factor the dmg bonus that Yelan can provide Cyno.
  </p><p>
    Note the above numbers assume quicken for Cyno, Nahida, Yae.
    But if Yelan is used, in practice there will be less quicken and more hyperbloom.
    A more accurate calculation would use non-quicken dps values for Cyno, Nahida, Yae,
    and add the hyperbloom dps.
    We assume full EM Nahida is used.
    We do not factor the buffs Nahida's Q gives to her E or team.
  </p><p>
    The other question is who is proccing hyperbloom: Cyno or Yae?
    Whose EM should we factor?
    For a lower bound, let's assume that hyperbloom is procced with 100 EM 
    (Cyno gives self 100 EM, Yae can reach 100 EM with Gilded).
    In reality, either can get more than 100 EM, especially if full EM Nahida with Q is used,
    but here we stay on the conservative side.
    From <a href='nilou.html'>Nilou</a>, the hyperbloom damage at 100 EM is 170%.
    An enemy can be damaged by bloom-related reactions at most 4 times per second.
  </p><p>
    The team dps is then
    $$652/1.5 + 243.5 + 488.0 + 445.4 + 4*170 = 2291.6$$
    So hyperbloom damage is so large that it can compensate for lack of quicken.
    More importantly, it compensates for lack of Bennett.
    A way to increase team dps is to give more EM to Cyno and Yae.
    In some teams reaching 1k EM is quite achievable.
    The above also ignores the occassional quicken and EC damage.
    It does not factor possible dendro res shred for Nahida.
  </p><p>
    There are several variants of the above Cyno team:
    Cyno-Nahida-Kuki-Yelan/XQ,
    Cyno-Nahida-Yae/Beidou-Kokomi, etc.
    For Cyno specifically, he really synergizes better with Nahida, Yelan/XQ, and characters that have long-lasting off-field abilities
    to match his 18s on-field time.
    Indeed, Nahida works well with many characters in the game, but arguably the character who needs Nahida the most is Cyno
    (for Cyno specifically, Nahida is almost irreplaceable).
  </p><p>
    Assume that Yae/Kuki have 1k EM and proc all the hyperblooms in the Cyno team.
    We will then ignore their regular damage.
    If there is one enemy, the team dps (Cyno-Nahida-Yae/Kuki-Yelan) is
    $$652/1.5 + 243.5 + 445.4 + 2400 = 3523.6$$
    One could also try 1k EM Cyno with no electro battery,
    but Cyno usually wants an electro partner for his 80 cost burst
    (even though he can sometimes recharge himself).
  </p>


  <h3>Alhaitham hyperbloom</h3>
  <p>Alhaitham-Nahida-Kuki C4-Yelan.
    Here we only have one electro, and we assume they have 1k EM build 
    (full EM, 4p gilded, EM weapon, etc.) to proc hyperbloom.
    As the electro character is built full EM, we will ignore their other sources of damage.
  </p><p>
    Alhaitham non-quicken dps is 330+115.9=445.9 (with Bennett).
    If there is one enemy that gets damaged by the max 4 hyperblooms per second
    (which might be achievable with c4 Kuki as opposed to Raiden or Yae), the team dps is
    $$445.9/1.5 + 243.5 + 445.4 + 2400 = 3386.2$$
    which is ridiculously high, surpassing many c6 units.
    If there are two enemies, dps is 
    $$445.9/1.5 + 243.5 + 445.4 + 2400/2 = 2186.2$$
    which is still top tier.
    If there are three enemies:
    $$445.9/1.5 + 243.5 + 445.4 + 2400/3 = 1786.2$$
    In the limit of infinite enemies, the base damage (from Alhaitham, Nahida, Yelan) is
    $$445.9/1.5 + 243.5 + 445.4 = 1134.8$$
    which itself can be enough to clear abyss (min dps needed is around 500% mv).
    Above the team dps is carried by the hyperbloom reaction (which can contribute half or more of the team dps).
    Hyperbloom dps is technically attributed to the electro driver's EM,
    but it requires a team of three elements to create (dendro, hydro, electro).
    Hyperbloom is an example of a very good reaction.
  </p><p>
    Why Nahida? She provides 100% uptime aoe dendro application via E without energy cost.
    That itself makes her more valuable than most other dendro supports in the game.
    The EM buff from her Q and her high sub-dps (when built for damage) is a bonus.
  </p><p>
    Above we ignored possible dendro res shred from Nahida,
    but an extra 30% dendro res shred would increase this already insane dps even more.
    The dendro res would increase Alhaitham's dps as well as the hyperbloom dps.
  </p>

  <p>Alhaitham-Yelan-XQ-Kuki C4:
    $$445.9/1.5 + 445.4 + 415.2 + 2400 = 3557.9$$
    Alhaitham can provide more dps, but requires more on-field and melee time than Nahida.
    Nahida provides off-field dendro application, is ranged, and can support the team with an EM buff,
    while still doing good damage.
  </p>


  <h3>Double hydro hyperbloom</h3>
  <p>Nahida-Yelan-XQ-Kuki C4:
    we assume C6 XQ and ignore effect of C2 res shred.
    For one enemy (with C4 Kuki)
    $$243.5 + 445.4 + 415.2 + 2400 = 3504.1$$
    This is top tier because hyperbloom is driving it.    
  </p>
  <p>This double hydro team is a bit less damage than the Alhaitham hyperbloom team
    as Alhaitham contributes a lot of damage.
    So why use double hydro? 
    It can provide the 25% hp buff, XQ can provide damage reduction and extra healing,
    and it makes hydro application easier (with double hydro both Yelan, XQ can spam their bursts on cd more).
  </p>
  <p>
    The advantage of Alhaitham (double dendro) over double hydro 
    is more dps, dendro resonance giving more EM to team,
    and bonus damage from dendro res shred.
  </p><p>
    The advantage of Cyno (double electro) hyperbloom is potentially even more dps than Alhaitham
    and more energy particles from electro resonance.
    However, Cyno requires more on-field time, whereas Alhaitham can be more flexible and played as a quickswap.
    Moreover, in double electro teams, one should build EM on both electro units in case hyperbloom is triggered by either electro unit.
    By contrast, in double dendro or double hydro where there is one electro unit, it is easy to stack 1k EM on that single electro driver.
  </p>

  <h3>Quickbloom versus pure Quicken</h3>
  <p>The general observation is that hyperbloom teams are superior to pure quicken teams for 1 or even 2 enemies.
    But when there 3 or more enemies, quicken and hyperbloom teams becomes comparable, with quicken even being a bit better
    due to the single-target nature of hyperbloom (sublinear aoe scaling).
  </p><p>
    Thus for defeating single bosses, hyperbloom teams can clear faster than quicken (and faster than most teams in the game).
  </p>

  <p>Achieving the max of 2 hyperblooms per .5s for a single target is often a pipe dream. 
    One would need to apply electro every .5s. 
    This can be done if you are using on-field Cyno as a driver or an electro catalyst like Yae for NA.
    But for most other off-field electro abilities, they will not apply electro every .5s.
    Kuki's E applies electro every 1.5s (becomes faster at c4).
    Raiden's E applies electro every .9s.
    Yae's E is not much faster.
    Fischl's Oz applies electro every 1s but has a long cd and does not have 100% uptime without Q (this is not solved by c1 or c6).
    So for off-field electro applicators with free 100% uptime (without using burst),
    we look at Raiden, Kuki, and Yae.
  </p><p>
    So unless one uses Cyno or Qing (who have near 100% uptime on electro infusion) or on-field Yae NA,
    the actual dps from hyperbloom will be less than 2400% mv.
    The damage of one hyperbloom at 1k em is around 600%.
    For Kuki E, it will be 2 hyperbloom damage instances every 1.5s (or 4/3 per second).
    It is not 4 because within a .5s window, there is a limit of 2 hyperblooms that can damage a single enemy.
    So when Kuki's E procs, even if it fires 4 hyperblooms, each enemy can only be damaged by 2.
    So Kuki's hyperbloom dps is 600*(4/3)=800%.
    This can increase with Kuki's C4 which gives her more electro app.
  </p><p>
    For Raiden, it is 2 hyperblooms every .9s (or around 2.22 per second).
    Raiden's hyperbloom dps is 1333%.
    It is higher than Kuki as Raiden's E can proc more frequently.
    It also has the advantage of greater range and longer uptime (lasts 25s).
    Kuki's advantage is that she can heal.
  </p><p>
    So if we use Raiden or Kuki with less than C4, the dps of the following teams change:
    Alhaitham-Nahida-Yelan-Raiden
    $$445.9/1.5 + 243.5 + 445.4 + 1333 = 2319.2$$
    Nahida-Yelan-XQ-Raiden
    $$243.5 + 445.4 + 415.2 + 1333 = 2437.1$$
    Alhaitham-Yelan-XQ-Raiden:
    $$445.9/1.5 + 445.4 + 415.2 + 1333 = 2490.9$$
    This is still insane dps surpassing many c6 teams.
    To take it to the next level (3k mv), one needs to apply electro faster (via C4 Kuki or on-field Yae/Cyno).
    The hyperbloom dps for Cyno teams is unchanged assuming Cyno and his electro partner both have 1k em
    (possible for Cyno if using full EM Nahida with burst, so you don't need a full EM Cyno and can invest into crit for his E nukes).
    Cyno hyperbloom can achieve the god status of 3k+ mv at c0 just because Cyno can apply electro faster as an on-field electro driver.
  </p><p>
    So why not Raiden burst as an on-field driver? You can do that, but Raiden's Q has 11s downtime.
    This is one situation where Cyno's ridiculously long 18s burst proves to be an advantage
    as it allows him to apply fast electro with near 100% uptime,
    which is perfect for hyperbloom due to the damage sequence limit.
  </p><p>
    To summarize, to reach the peak hyperbloom dps (3k+ mv), one can do:
    Cyno 1k em, Alhaitham with C4 Kuki, or Nahida with C4 Kuki.
    The hydro units to maximize subdps include Yelan, XQ.
    In absence of Cyno or C4 Kuki, full EM Raiden E or full EM Yae can be used in lieu.
  </p><p>
    Technically, if Cyno is proccing the hyperbloom that damage is attributed to him,
    which means in hyperbloom teams, his own C0 dps becomes
    $$652/1.5 + 2400 = 2834.7$$
    which is already at the level of C6 units.
    If there are two electro with 1k em in the Cyno team, then say half of the hyperblooms are attributable to Cyno:
    $$652/1.5 + 1200 = 1634.7$$
    which is still C6 level.
    In either case, most of Cyno's dps is via hyperbloom.
  </p>

  <p>
    Above analysis is for single targets.
    For multiple enemies, it is possible for 4 hyperblooms to split as 2 hyperblooms for 2 enemies per second
    (e.g. Raiden E proc 4 hyperblooms every .9s).
    Then the scaling is 1200% per enemy.
  </p>


<h2>Itto</h2>
  <p>Itto, Albedo, Zhongli with -40% Geo RES (-20% from resonance and -20% from Zhongli), 
    ignoring buffs from Gorou from having several Geo party members, 
    ignoring buffs from Zhongli stele resonance, 
    ignoring 15% DMG bonus from Geo resonance on Itto.
    $$(517.7 + 257.8)*1.278 = 991.089$$
    Higher than melt Ganyu.
  </p><p>
    Itto-Raiden-Zhongli. Raiden 7s q fills downtime of Itto's q, while also acting as a battery:
    $$517.7*1.278 + 494.1*1.167 = 1238.2353$$
  </p>

  <h2>Scaramouche</h2>
  <p>Scaramouche, Faruzan, Bennett, Yelan.
    Scaramouche, Nahida, Kuki, Yelan (hyperbloom taser).
    Scaramouche, Yelan, XQ, Bennett.
  </p>

  <h2>Pyro DPS</h2>
  <h3>Diluc</h3>
  <p>VV shred from Anemo unit, ignoring damage done by Anemo unit.
    C0 Yelan
    $$(634 + 445.4 + 59.67)*1.278 = 1455.7$$
  </p>

  <h3>Yoimiya</h3>
  <p>Yoimiya-Yun Jin-Beidou-Bennett
    $$608.3 + 618.8 = 1227.1$$
    Does not factor in overloaded damage.
    Can also try Yoimiya-Beidou-Kazuha-Bennett
    $$(404.0 + 618.8)*1.278 = 1307.1384$$
  </p>

  <h3>Hu Tao</h3>
  <p>We consider Hu Tao-Yelan-Thoma-Kazuha for VV shred or else there is no way Hu Tao can compete.
    VV shred from Anemo unit, ignoring damage done by Anemo unit
    $$(435.4 + 445.4)*1.278 = 1125.6624$$
    But this is really Yelan/Xingqiu carrying Hu Tao.
    Note using Zhongli will result in less damage (VV shred provides more RES shred than ZL).
  </p>

<h2>Cryo DPS</h2>
  <h3>Eula</h3>
  <p>Eula-Raiden. Superconduct -40% Physical RES for Eula, Raiden's burst during the downtime
    $$494.1+443.8*1.278 = 1061.2764$$
    This is ignoring the additional Phys RES shred from Eula E
    and the burst dmg bonus provided by Raiden's E.
    This is higher than melt Ganyu and similar to Itto, Chongyun national, Childe international.
  </p><p>
    Eula-Beidou. Superconduct -40% Physical RES for Eula
    $$443.8*1.278+618.8 = 1185.9764$$
  </p>

  <h3>Ganyu melt</h3>
  <p>Ganyu teams and Ganyu suck in general. Whoever uses these are bad at making teams.</p>
  <p>Suppose use Zhongli shield. Ganyu melt + Xiangling
    $$(376.5*1.5 + 265)*1.167 = 968.31825$$
    This is inferior to Raiden national and has bigger energy issues.
    There are many holes in this team.
    This essentially gives Ganyu an 80 energy cost ult with Xiangling,
    and funneling energy to XL is painful.
  </p>

  <h3>Morgana</h3>
  <p>
    Ganyu freeze is inferior to Ganyu melt.
    The only good things about Morgana are Mona and Venti.
    But they are more efficiently used on other teams.
  </p><p>
    Morgana does not have Bennett, so it gets taxed by a factor of 1.5.
    The team dps is
    $$(376.52 + 340.68 + 314.9/2 + 300)/1.5 = 783.1$$
    With vv shred
    $$((376.52 + 340.68 + 314.9/2)*1.278 + 300)/1.5 = 945.2018$$
    This ignores 60% dmg bonus from Mona on Ganyu and Venti (but is included in Mona's burst).
  </p>


  <h2>National teams</h2>
  <p>See <a href='national.html'>national</a></p>

  <h2>Taser</h2>
  <p>Sucrose-Beidou-Xingqiu-Bennett
    $$618.8 + 479 = 1097.8$$
    Ignoring reaction damage from swirl, EC.
    Without Bennett divide by 1.5.
    To compensate, the reaction damage needs to be quite high (build EM on Sucrose).
    Also without Bennett, and using say Fischl instead, the team will lose a healer.
    There is also a Qiqi variant.
  </p>

  <h2>Fireworks</h2>
  <p>Beidou-Childe with vv shred
    $$(618.8 + 269.84)*1.278 = 1135.68192$$
  </p>


  <h2>Lazy hyperbloom</h2>
  <p>A hyperbloom team that requires doing (almost) nothing:
    Nahida / Yaoyao, Yae / Kuki, Kokomi.
    In <a href='elements.html'>elements</a> we computed that for 1k EM electro driver,
    hyperbloom has an effective scaling of around 600% per hit.
    It is limited to 2 hits per 0.5s.
    But oftentimes this game-coded max cannot be achieved due to the rates of application by the hydro, electro, or dendro unit.
    For Nahida, she applies dendro say once per 2.5s. Even Yaoyao has ICD with her dendro app.
    Nahida can buff her app rate if there are electro characters in the team (or with C1),
    but one of the fastest dendro apps is Alhaitham with his NA + mirrors.
    (The issue with baizhu is that he has icd on his NA.)
    Some people try to increase dendro app rate further by adding more dendro characters to the team.
    But often Alhaitham applies dendro so fast that he can be used as the sole dendro character in a bloom team
    (although it is usually recommended to pair him with Nahida or Yaoyao for dendro resonance).
  </p><p>
    But say we have Nahida at one bloom core per 2.5s.
    Many hydro applicators can apply hydro faster than once every 2.5s, including Kokomi, Yelan, XQ.
    Many electro applicators can deal electro damage faster than once per 2.5s, including Raiden and Kuki.
    So here the bottleneck is the dendro app.
    So we assume we have one hyperbloom every 2.5s.
    Then the dps is 240%.
    This alone will not make hyperbloom op. You need to increase the rate of dendro app.
  </p><p>
    With Nahida specifically, this can be done by doing NA with her while also using her E.
    This way both her NA and E can apply dendro.
  </p>


  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>A couple of support characters appear frequently in top clearing teams:
    Bennett (universal atk buff), Mona (universal dmg bonus buff), Nahida, Raiden, Yelan.
    Even Venti, Zhongli, Kazuha are not as often needed now that dendro has opened many new teams.
  </p>
  <p>In version 1, Venti trivialized everything.
    In version 2, Rational was all the rage for being a simple team to build that could clear abyss quite easily.
    In version 3, now hyperbloom has taken the spotlight for being even easier to build and being capable of achieving higher dps for less.
    At the center of hyperbloom was the new element dendro along with characters like Nahida and Alhaitham.
  </p><p>
    The next question is what new teams will version 4 open up?
  </p>
