  <p>Candace (Golden Vow) is a half-blooded descendant of the Scarlet King and has heterochromatic eyes, one amber and one azure.
    She is the first hydro polearm character in the game.
    She says that a shield is not enough to defend her village, which is why she must also wield a spear.
    Hey that's pretty good. The scriptwriters are learning not to be like that virgin cuckold zhongli who only shields but does no damage.
  </p>

  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>Her E is a parry like Yun Jin and Beidou. It can do aoe damage.
    Her Q can give a hydro infusion.
    It would be interesting to use her with Chongyun and C6 Bennett.
  </p>

  <h2>Infusions</h2>
  <!-- maybe create separate article -->
  <p>Many characters can infuse their element.
    Catalysts and bow users can readily deal elemental damage.
    Polearm, Claymore, Sword users usually gain an infusion through their skills.
    A few characters can give team-wide infusions such as Chongyun E, Bennett C6, and now Candace Q.
    Some infusions cannot be overridden (Xiao, Itto, Raiden, etc.).
    But others can be.
  </p><p>
    Certain infusion abilities will constantly apply or 'refresh' the infusion to the weapon (Chongyun, Bennett, Diluc).
    Let's call these strong infusions.
    But other infusion abilities will not refresh (Keqing E, Kazuha C6, Ayaka after sprinting).
    Let's call these weak infusions.
    Because weak infusions do not refresh, they can be overridden by the stronger infusions.
    For example, C6 Kazuha's infusion is weak and can be consumed by Chongyun's and Bennett's strong infusion field.
    This consumption process actually produces a swirl reaction (based on Chongyun/Bennett's EM).
    So the mechanics behind infusions are related to the gauge theory.
  </p><p>
    But what happens if you have multiple strong infusions at the same time?
    It has been observed that when using Chongyun and Bennett's infusions at the same time,
    the infusion can actually oscillate between cryo and pyro.
