  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  <p>Candace (Golden Vow) is a half-blooded descendant of the Scarlet King and has heterochromatic eyes, one amber and one azure.
    She is the first hydro polearm character in the game.
    She says that a shield is not enough to defend her village, which is why she must also wield a spear.
    Hey that's pretty good. The scriptwriters are learning not to be like that virgin cuckold zhongli who only shields but does no damage.
  </p>

  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>Her E is a parry like Yun Jin and Beidou. It can do aoe damage.
    It can also do a lot of poise damage (deal more damage to things like geo shields).
  </p><p>
    Her Q can give a hydro infusion.
    It would be interesting to use her with Chongyun and C6 Bennett.
    See <a href='infusion.html'>infusions</a> for more details.
  </p><p>
    The Q also provides 20% dmg bonus to NA.
    Her passive also provides .5% NA dmg bonus for every 1k points of hp.
    So if she has 30k hp she can give 15% more dmg bonus, for a total of 35% dmg bonus.
  </p><p>
    Her other passive (Aegis of Crossed Arrows) makes her E finish charging if she is hit.
  </p>

  <h2>Constellations</h2>
  <p>C1 increases q duration from 9 to 12 seconds, making it equal to the duration of Yun Jin and Bennett's bursts.
    C2 gives Candace 20% more hp when hitting enemies with E.
    C4 makes e press and hold cd equal.
    C6 makes q do extra aoe hydro dmg when NA, thereby increasing the hydro application.
  </p>

  <h2>Build</h2>
  <p>In Candace's trial, she is using 2p emblem with 2p tenacity. She also used the catch polearm.
  </p>

  <h2>Teams</h2>
  <p>Can be used on teams with Cyno, Diluc, Yoimiya, Eula, Childe, etc.</p>


  <h2>Trivia</h2>
  <p>Candace or Kandake is a Meroitic term, meaning sister of the king of Kush.
    For example, Amanishakheto was a Kandake of Kush.
    Kush was an ancient Egyptian kingdom that existed from roughly 1000 bc to 500 ad.
    Meroitic was also an ancient Egyptian language, with linguists classifying it as either 
    Afroasiatic (similar to Arabic, Hebrew)
    or Nilo-Saharan (similar to other African languages).
  </p><p>
    Candace is a Latin transcription of the word Kandake,
    found in the New Testament.
  </p><p>
    A note on languages: Egyptian, Assyrian (Akkadian), Coptic, Hebrew are all Afro-Asiatic languages.
    Coptic descends from Egyptian, but nowadays Egyptian is an extinct branch of the Afro-Asiatic family.
    Instead, Arabic (dialect) is spoken in Egypt, with Arabic descending from another branch of the Afro-Asiatic family.
    Akkadian is also an extinct Afro-Asiatic branch.
    Hebrew is still spoken to this day (though modern Hebrew is quite different from Old Testament / Tanakh Hebrew).
    Another language used at the time was ancient Greek (which is quite different from modern Greek).
    Greek is from a separate language family (European) from the Afro-Asiatic languages mentioned above.
  </p><p>
    The fact that languages evolve and change over time is not too surprising.
    Given the span of 2000 years a lot can happen.
    England was conquered by Germanic people and then French people.
    Even the modern Chinese Putonghua / Mandarin is quite different from the Chinese language spoken during the Han dynasty.
    Modern Chinese has more northern influence from the conquests of the Mongol and Man people.
  </p><p>
    There is a story that Alexander the Great battled against Candace of Meroe.
    Alexander did not intend to conquer Nubia and decided to conquer Egypt instead.
    Some other stories like the Alexander Romance say that Alexander and Candace had a romantic affair.
    Some modern storywriters portray Candace as an Indian princess that Alexander encountered on his Indian campaign.
