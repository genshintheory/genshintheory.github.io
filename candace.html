  <p>Candace (Golden Vow) is a half-blooded descendant of the Scarlet King and has heterochromatic eyes, one amber and one azure.
    She is the first hydro polearm character in the game.
    She says that a shield is not enough to defend her village, which is why she must also wield a spear.
    Hey that's pretty good. The scriptwriters are learning not to be like that virgin cuckold zhongli who only shields but does no damage.

  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>Her E is a parry like Yun Jin and Beidou. It can do aoe damage.
    Her Q can give a hydro infusion.
    It would be interesting to use her with Chongyun and C6 Bennett.
