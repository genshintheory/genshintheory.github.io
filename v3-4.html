    <title>Version 3.4</title>
  </head>
 
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>


<p>Version 3.4 will feature Alhaitham, Yaoyao,
  the Lantern Rite, and a new desert region in Sumeru.
</p>

<h2>Hadramaveth</h2>
<p>The new desert region features a tornado, and the sandstorms can obscure vision.
  Old ruins of Gurabad
</p>

<h2>Lantern rite</h2>
<p>There are four main activities: 
  the Aegis of sparks racing trial, the paper puzzle, the boat challenge, and the battle challenge.
  </p>

  <p>First half will feature Alatus (Xiao) and Alhaitham, the two Als, alongside Yaoyao.
    Second half will feature Yelan and Hu Tao.
    This follows the pattern from version 3.3 of putting the two male five stars on the first half
    and the two female five stars on the second half.
  </p>

  <p>This version's characters are centered on the Qing dynasty.
    Yelan and Hu Tao contain allusions to Lan Yu and Hu Weiyong, who were both executed by Zhu Yuanzhang, founder of the Ming.
    Meanwhile, Xiao and Alhaitham contain allusions to the Aisin-Gioro clan who destroyed the Ming.
    So the version's characters pair the victims with their saviors.
  </p>

  <p>The storyline involving Hu Tao and Xinyan rapping and sitting down for dinner
    appears like an attempt to resolve a certain workplace conflict between two colleagues... corporate politics.
    Then why not put Xinyan on Hu Tao's banner?
    Trying to reward corrupt people would only seem to breed more corruption.
    Got to catch the low-lying flies and high-flying tigers...
