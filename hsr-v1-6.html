  <h2>Trailblaze continuance</h2>
  <p>The Skara bug boss is Argenti impact.
    Come up with a better name for this boss, like ptakhur.
  </p><p>

    As of 1.6 there is no 5* ice erudition or imaginary erudition.

  </p>

  <p>There seems to be a pattern with Yoimiya in 4.3 and Asta in this quest.
    Some people deserve to be put under Asta as well.
  </p>

  <p>This is a cake breeding event.
    So it seems Ruan Mei is a biologist/geneticist, and one of her hobbies is breeding.
