  <h2>Trailblaze continuance</h2>
  <p>The Skara bug boss is Argenti impact.
    Come up with a better name for this boss, like ptakhur.
  </p><p>
    Jingliu also works.
    Suppose Herta could work.
    As of 1.6 there is no 5* ice erudition or imaginary erudition.
    Ratio is too ST to handle the swarm of flies.
  </p><p>
    Ruan Mei's toughness break buff helps against big bosses with a lot of gauge toughness shields.
  </p>

  <p>There seems to be a pattern with Yoimiya in 4.3 and Asta in this quest.
    Some people deserve to be put under Asta as well.
  </p>


  <h2>Creation Nurturing (DNA event)</h2>
  <p>This is a cake breeding event.
    So it seems Ruan Mei is a biologist/geneticist, and one of her hobbies is breeding.
  </p><p>
    Also does this kind of event contribute anything to society?
    It's like getting a cat and naming it Furina (legal as HSR universe is outside Fontaine's jurisdiction)
    or getting a poodle and naming it Navia.
  </p>


  <h2>Youci: Pure Fiction mode</h2>
  <p>Erudition units are very good here (JY, Argenti, etc.).</p>
  <p>It seems Yinshu likes to walk birds (遛鸟).</p>
