  <p>Blade is an upgrade from hu tao.</p>

  <h2>Kit</h2>
  <p>Blade's skill sacrifices hp to buff his NA and dmg bonus.
    His NA does blasts, giving him some aoe, unlike hu tao who is more single target (hunt).
    While in this buffed mode (hellscape), his NA do not create skill points.
    His NA will also consume more of his hp.
    His ultimate does a blast of aoe anemo damage to enemies.
    So far this appears derivative of hu tao's kit and maybe even similar to Xiao with the hp drain over time (when using NA).
  </p>

  <p>
    However, this is where Blade becomes better than hu tao:
    Each time Blade takes damage (or loses hp from skill), he gains 1 stack of charge.
    Once he reaches 5 stacks of charge, he will do an aoe attack on all enemies on field, while restoring his hp.
    Hu tao lacks this kind of charge mechanic.
  </p><p>
    Moreover, Blade's burst deals additional damage based on how much hp he has lost so far in battle.
    Using his burst will reset this value to 0, and hp lost will start accumulating again.
    He can also heal himself when attacking weakness-broken enemies.
  </p><p>
    His attacks scale directly with hp and atk (dual scaling like Dehya),
    whereas hu tao deals atk-scaling damage, and hu tao's skill buffs her atk based on her hp.
    And hu tao has a cd for her skill use, whereas Blade does not (it is just that his NA do not create sp).

  <h2>The dao of destruction</h2>
  <p>
    Blade is a classic example of a destruction-type character:
    he possesses great survivability, can self-heal, can tank a lot of hits,
    and once he tanks enough hits he will unleash more damage.
    And the more hp he loses, the more damage he does (this is amplified further by his E4).
    So he has this sacrificing mechanism: he can sacrifice some of his own health but in return do more damage to the enemy.
    And because Blade scales with hp and can heal himself, he tends to have greater survivability in battle so he can afford to sacrifice some hp.
  </p><p>
    The imagery of him cutting himself with his sword to draw blood is very graphic and much more emo-like.
    It is almost to exaggerate the type of sacrifices that destruction characters like the guardian yaksha Xiao make to buff themselves.
    It must be clarified that this kind of self-sacrifice must be differed from suicide.
    Perhaps the first thing that must be emphasized about destruction characters is that they have great <i>survivability</i>.
    They can live and survive. That is the first most important thing.
    When they sacrifice something, like their health or whatever, they are not offing themselves or committing suicide,
    they need to live first to tell the tale and then turn that sacrifice into increased damage.
    The moment you go into suicidal territory, you die and lose the game.
    The path of destruction is dangerous and can result in getting killed.
    That is what makes it high risk high reward.
  </p><p>
    When Blade consumes his hp, he will never commit suicide.
    The most that will happen is that his hp will drop to 1.
    Same thing with Xiao: his hp decreases until it hits 1, at which it will stop decreasing.
  </p><p>
    Committing suicide ('offing oneself') is the act of an idiot. 
    The dao of destruction is completely different.
    You have to be smart to know the difference between suicide versus survivability and sacrifice in exchange for buff.
    Even if you suffer a huge failure in life or you suffered a great loss to bring down your enemy, 
    as long as your hp is above 0, you have not yet died and can still survive.
    As long as your enemy is dead and you are still alive, it almost does not matter how much hp you lost. 
    You can recover it and live to fight the next battle.
    But if you die and lose, it is game over. The sacrifices you made almost become meaningless and not much different from suicide in that case.
    Not everybody can walk the path of destruction and live to tell the tale.
  </p>
  <p>
    Destruction characters almost need to compensate for the risk of dying by dealing more damage than normal.
    That is why destruction characters like Xiao or Itto have high innate motion values, while taking a risk of sacrificing some superfluous attribute.
    But they can hedge this risk by being tankier or possessing greater survivability than normal 
    (Xiao can jump to avoid attacks like Freya in FF9, and Itto has high defense and can shield himself as a geo unit).
    What exactly does Itto sacrifice again? Oh yeah, during his burst he reduces his damage resistance.
    But this is almost like a cheatcode since as a geo unit he will be shielded much of the time,
    and because he has high innate defense he can tank a ton of damage like a sponge anyways.
  </p><p>
    If you are more conservative or do not like taking risks, perhaps the path of destruction is not for you.
    They are plenty of non-destruction characters that do not make such self-sacrifices but still deal a ton of damage, such as Cyno.
