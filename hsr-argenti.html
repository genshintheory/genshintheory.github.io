<title>Argenti</title>

  <p>Argenti (銀枝 pronounced Ginshi in Japanese) is a physical erudition unit.
  </p>
  <p>Also, Argenti seems to make something more obvious,
    whereas Ayaka is a bit more subtle.
  </p>


  <h2>Kit</h2>
  <p>Argenti (銀枝 Ginshi) has two bursts, a 90 cost version and 180 cost version.
    Let's call them Q1, Q2.
    His E and Q are aoe.
    His Q2 has higher scaling than Q1.
    Moreover Q2 deals 6 extra instances of bounce damage to random enemies.
  </p>
  <p>Also, for each enemy hit when he uses his basic atk, E, Q,
    he gains a stack of ascend and regenerates 3 energy.
    He can have up to 10 stacks,
    and each stack gives him more crit rate.
  </p>

  <h2>Ginshi in Genshin</h2>
  <p>There is currently no Genshin character with 2 different Q (that cost different energy).
    Childe's Q is 60 energy no matter which form he uses.
    Also there is no 'physical' vision per se in Genshin.
  </p><p>
    Ginshi E can do aoe damage.
    His Q1 can do an aoe nuke.
    His Q2 can do a bigger nuke.
  </p><p>
    For each enemy hit by AA/E/Q, he gains x energy and a stack of ascend, which increases his cr, up to 10 stacks.
    This effect can occur once per y seconds.
