<h2>Talents</h2>
<h3>Elemental Skill</h3>
<p>Like Yun Jin's skill, this is a parry.
  At Lv13, the scaling on a perfect parry (or when max of 2 hits taken) is
  $$258.4+680 = 938.4$$
  which is quite high for a 7.5s cd (it is a nuke).
  Basically a perfect parry will quadruple the damage compared to not parrying at all.
  The skill also has greater AoE on a perfect parry.
</p><p>
  Assuming 4p emblem with 46.6% dmg bonus, the dps of a perfect parry is
  $$x_e = 1.466*938.4/7.5 = 183.4$$
</p><p>
  Somehow, Beidou, Qing, and Cyno all are electro and have 7.5s cd on their E.
  As for scaling, Beidou > Qing > Cyno (outside burst), which looks like a cruel joke to Cyno.
  But when Cyno uses his burst, his E becomes buffed immensely (500+ scaling nuke every 4s).
</p>


<h3>Elemental Burst</h3>
<p>Her q will bounce between multiple enemies. Her C2 increases the number of discharges.
  At level 13, the scaling on a lightning discharge is \(d_0 = 204\)%.
  There is at most one discharge per second,
  and discharges proc when normal and charged attacks hit
  (it can proc on Tartaglia's E attacks but not Raiden's Q attacks;
  this is Genshin's way of balancing Raiden).
  </p><p>
  Each time it procs it will jump to up to 3 targets (which can be the same) per second.
  With her C2, it can jump to up to 5 targets per second.
  This means the total damage per enemy is bounded above by a constant.
  The burst lasts 15 seconds with an 80 energy cost and 20s cd.
  </p><p>
    Suppose Beidou is Lv. 90 (has 24% Electro DMG bonus from ascending)
    with 4 piece Emblem with Electro DMG Bonus goblet and 200% ER.
    The total DMG Bonus on the burst is
    \( 200(.25) + 46.6 + 24 = 120.6 \)
    The MV on a discharge is then
    $$d = 2.206d_0 = 450.024$$
    and this can occur at most once every second.
    In practice it is possible to proc the discharge around 10-12 times.
    With fast attackers like Yoimiya etc. it is possible to proc it more.
    Slower attackers like claymores will proc it less.
    So against a single target, if it procs around 11 times on average, for 15s with a 20s cd, the DPS is
    $$x_1 = 11d/20 = 247.5132$$
    Beidou excels more in AoE situations, when there is more than one enemy.
    Note the calculation does not factor the initial hit of the burst (scaling 258.4% which averages to around +13 DPS).
  </p><p>
    For 1 enemy, scaling is d.
    For 2 enemies, scaling per enemy is 5d/2 as now the discharge can start bouncing between enemies.
    For \(n\ge 2\) enemies, the scaling per enemy is \(5d/n\).
  </p><p>
    So Beidou's DPS per enemy peaks when there are exactly 2 enemies.
    This situation happens in various domains and iterations of the Spiral Abyss.
    In this case the DPS becomes
    $$x_2 = 5x_1/2 = 618.783$$
    So Beidou has high DPS without reactions, and this is an off-field ability.
  </p><p>
    Note for more than 2 enemies the damage per enemy decreases (scaling is sub-linear).
    For example, for 3 enemies the DPS is
    $$x_3 = 5x_1/3 = 412.522$$
  </p>
  <p>
  It may be shocking how high Beidou's dps is for a 4 star.
  Even without reactions, she beats many 5 star characters including Hu Tao and Ganyu.
  As an Electro DPS Beidou is clearly better than Keqing,
  and in AoE situations can even be a better DPS than the Raiden Shogun.
  Her burst is simply broken.
  </p><p>
  Note that Beidou's Q has normal ICD (follows a 3 hit rule),
  so due to how frequently the discharges attack in a given second,
  usually she will be the one triggering Electro reactions,
  meaning her EM is factored into the reaction,
  unless she is paired with a character that can attack faster than or keep up with Beidou (a C6 Yoimiya might).
  However, since Beidou does so much damage herself, 
  usually one wants to build more CRIT, ATK, DMG Bonus than EM for Beidou.
</p>
  <p>
  The first hit of Beidou's q applies 4C electro (when she slams her sword into the ground).
  The discharges apply 1A electro.
  Her q snapshots and also provides DMG reduction.
  With her C1 her q generates a shield that scales with her HP.
</p>
<p>
  For how much damage and utility it provides, her Q Stormbreaker easily qualifies as one of the best bursts in game
  and solidifies her position as one of the best sub-DPS characters.
  </p>

<h2>Build</h2>
<p>4 piece Emblem (released in Version 2.0) is her bis.
  4p Gilded can be used for quicken builds.
</p><p>
  ATK sands, Electro DMG goblet, CRIT circlet.
  Substats: CRIT > ATK, ER.
</p>
<p>
  5 star weapons: Wolf, Skyward Pride, Redhorn, Beacon.
  4 star weapons: Sea lord, Serpent Spine, Favonius.
</p>

<h2>Teams</h2>
<p>
  Main teams archetypes include quicken, Eula, fireworks, taser.
  For electro batteries, Yae, Raiden, Fischl, Kuki can work.
  Note Beidou Q can proc on both NA and CA.
</p><p>
  Some example teams include:
  Cyno-Beidou-Nahida, Itto-Beidou, Childe-Beidou fireworks, Eula-Beidou-Raiden, Sucrose-Beidou-Yelan taser, 
  Alhaitham-Beidou, Scaramouche-Beidou.
</p><p>
  Beidou tends to work very well with Alhaitham.
