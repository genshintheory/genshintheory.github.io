<h2>Xiao artifact</h2>
<p>Xiao is a yaksha. Yakshas are related to Sumeru. 
Chasm is at southwest Liyue, probably next to Sumeru.
Hence Xiao's artifact is in the chasm.
QED.
</p>
<p>Xiao's artifact (Vermillion Hereafter/VH): the 4p gives 48% ATK, equivalent to an R5 TTDS buff.
  Can expect a 10-33% increase in damage depending on how many other attack buffs you are using.
  For example, if you are not using Bennett/Pyro resonance/Noblesse/ToM/TTDS,
  the increase in damage can be larger.
</p>

<h2>Normal Attack artifact</h2>
<p>The EO artifact has a random component built into it.
  It can be used on characters that rely on NA for most of their dps (e.g. Yoimiya, Razor, etc.)
  Note that the Gladiator set and Shimenawa set also exist.
</p>

<h2>Dark mud</h2>
<p>The dark mud mechanism seems similar to the corrosion effect in the 2.5 Enkanomiya event,
  where you had to use the Bokuso box to dispel the corrosion to defeat enemies and solve puzzles.
</p>

<h2>Chests</h2>
<p>On top of the nail there is a chest</p>
