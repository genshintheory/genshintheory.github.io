<title>Cyno</title>

  </head>
  
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  <p>
    Cyno is the poster character of Sumeru and featured in the Teyvat trailer.
    Cyno could be a reference to Cynocephaly or having the head of a jackal.    
    This features in Egyptian, Greek, and Roman mythology.
    In Egypt, cynocephaly is a characteristic of the gods Duamutef, Wepwawet (Ra), and Anubis.
  </p><p>
    Duamutef or the Golden Dawn is a guardian deity.
    Wepwawet is a god of war and wolf deity, and Cyno's constellation is called 金狼 meaning Golden Wolf.
    His outfit is like an Egyptian Pharoah's,
    and his headpiece does make him resemble Anubis.
    Anubis is the god of the underworld and has a canine head.
  </p><p>
    Cyno's title is Mahamatra, an Indian title established by emperor Ashoka and referring to an 'officer of morality'.
  </p>

  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>His q will give him electro infusion and EM. 
    It also gives interruption resistance and EC immunity (similar to Raiden q).
    In the last hit of his NA combo animation, he throws down a lightning bolt.
  </p><p>
    During his q, a circle will periodically flash on screen.
    With one of his passives, if he uses his e (chasmic soulfarer) when the circle appears, it will increase the e dmg by 35%
    and fire three dustbolts (similar to Chongyun's c1 passive or Sara's q) that have 100% atk scaling each.
    The e does aoe damage.
  </p>
  <p>Using his e during his q can also extend the duration of his q.
    The q lasts a maximum of 18s.
  </p>

  <h2>Build</h2>
  <p>4p gilded is his bis given his EM scaling. 
    4p Thundering Fury (TF) for E spam, 2 TF 2 Gilded, 2 Gilded 2 WT, 4p glad for NA buff are also viable.
    There is no point in using Thundersoother when Mona and other ample dmg bonus sources exist for electro.
  </p><p>
    The Echo set is the worst set to use.
    When your career is based on the FBI backing you and attacking your political opponents,
    you deserve to be called the worst.
  </p><p>
    <s>Emblem is an interesting option (as is anything that buffs q damage).
    Emblem is Raiden's bis as most of her dmg is through her Q.
    Emblem can also buff Cyno's NA damage.</s>
    Unlike Raiden, Cyno works and synergizes well with Beidou.
    But at the same time, Emblem does not appear to work with Cyno.
    Besides Cyno also relies on E damage (including dustbolts), which emblem does not buff.
    On the other hand, TF focuses a bit too much on E.
    But Gilded's EM buff increases ALL of Cyno's damage (E and NA damage).
    So Gilded is the best and most comprehensive set for Cyno.
  </p>

  <h2>Weapons</h2>
  <p>Sand king is his bis by far. The EM to ATK conversion is quite high.
    PJWS is would be his next bis.
    Other good weapons are homa, catch, prototype, even white tassel.
    The kitain spear does give EM but the passive is kind of gimmicky, removing energy but then giving it back over time.
  </p>

  <h2>Teams</h2>
  <p>Technically Cyno can be used in any team Raiden is used in.
    This includes Cyno international (Cyno-Kujou-Bennett-Anemo), 
    Cyno rational (Cyno-XL-Yelan/XQ), Cyno-Eula, and Cyno-Yae.
    The Cyno rational becomes even more like Rational with Cyno's c4 which gives him battery abilities.
    Cyno-Eula also benefits from the c4 (though both Cyno and Eula take up on field time compared to Raiden).
  </p><p>
    Given Cyno's EM scaling he can also be built in aggravate comps (Cyno-Dendro).
    He can also be played on taser teams (electro-hydro-anemo).
  </p><p>
    Cyno synergizes with many different supports including:
    Beidou, Yae, Sara, Fischl, Candace, Yelan, Yun Jin, XQ, XL, Dendro MC.
    He also benefits from Anemo vv and Bennett.
  </p><p>
    Other teams include: Cyno Beidou Yelan Bennett (Cyno fireworks) or Cyno Beidou XL Bennett.
  </p>


  <h2>Calculations</h2>
  <p>Assume lv 10 E and Q with 4p Gilded, 46.6% dmg bonus, and 200 EM (gilded 80 + substats).
    During Q he gains 100 EM.
    When triggering a reaction he can gain 100 to 150 more EM.
    Suppose he is run on double electro (with Yae, Sara, etc.) so that he gains 100 EM on reaction.
    He can then get a total of 400 EM during his burst.
    On some builds he can possibly get more than 400 EM (like if using the missive weapon which gives ~100 more EM),
    but to demonstrate a simple calculation, we assume 400 EM for now.
  </p><p>
    He can use his E skill 5 times during his Q:
    4 times it will be buffed during the endseer stance
    and once at the beginning (unbuffed).
    The first endseer circle will appear ~6s after using his Q.
    After that the endseer circle will appear once every ~4s until the end of his burst.
  </p><p>
    The lv 10 E mortuary rite has 282% scaling and 3s cd.
    When it is buffed it will gain 35% dmg bonus and fire three dust bolts that deal 100% scaling each.
    From his other passive the dust bolt dmg is increased by 250% of Cyno's EM.
    So if he has 400 EM, that is 1000 more flat dmg.
    Suppose Cyno has 2000 atk.
    Then the flat dmg of one dust bolt is 2000+1000=3000 or equivalently 150% scaling each.
    The e dps is then
    $$z_e = (282*1.466 + 4*(282*1.816 + 3*150*1.466))/18 = 283.37$$
  </p><p>
    Above the dust bolt dmg contributes 146.6 of the mv or around half, so it is quite significant.
  </p><p>
    Cyno will also na during his burst in between his Es.
    Using gilded dreams, it is possible to do the full 5-hit NA combo in between consecutive Es.
    It is even possible to do more than 5 hits.
    But for simplicity we assume between every pair of Es he will do a 5-hit NA combo.
    So he will do the full combo 4 times.
  </p><p>
    For a lv 10 Q the full combo has 987% total scaling.
    His na are also buffed by 150% of his EM.
    For 400 EM this is 600 flat dmg per NA.
    If he has 2000 atk then the effective scaling is
    $$x_a = (2000*9.87 + 5*600)/2000 = 11.37 = 1137%$$
    So the em scaling can increase the overall na dmg by a bit more than 10%.
  </p><p>
    The dps from na is then
    $$z_a = 4*1.466x_a/18 = 370.41$$
    The last hit of his 5-hit na combo has higher scaling compared to the other hits.
  </p><p>
    The total dps from his na and E is then
    $$z = z_a + z_e = 663.78$$
    So Cyno's dps is quite high.
    The golden wolf is definitely an upgrade from Razor (so the 3.1 Mondstadt event can be thought of as Razor's retirement).
    Moreover, it is higher than Keqing's dps.
    Not just that, among C0 electro characters as of version 3.1, Cyno has the highest dps (among electro).
    This is interesting given that Raiden, Yae, and Keqing have higher base ATK.
    But those other electro characters also have more supportive roles, whether via battery, sub-dps, quickswap, exploration, etc.
    Cyno's base atk 318 is decently high though (above Klee, lower than Yoimiya/Keqing), 
    considering that other dps units released before like Ayato and Tighnari had a much worse time.
  </p>

  <h3>Approximating C6 Xiao</h3>
  <p>It can be said that a C0 Cyno 'approximates' a C6 Xiao.
    However, obviously Cyno will not use his E as often.
    Whereas C6 Xiao can use his E six times per second, Cyno may probably only use his E six times during his entire 18s burst.
    But the fact that Cyno kind of has C6 Xiao technology built into him at C0 already makes Cyno one of the best dps in the game
    (and one of the best dps we have had in a long while since Itto and Yae).
    Some people try to take the Xiao analogy even further by using TF for more E spam.
  </p>
  <p>
    The 4p TF will reduce the E cd by 1s when triggering electro reactions from 3 to 2s, so within 18s he can technically use his E nine times
    if he consistently triggers reactions (in practice this is not the case which makes TF less optimal).
    If you use TF, you get 15% more dmg bonus, you can use the E up to 4 more times possibly (but those will not be buffed), 
    but you lose around 200 EM (500 flat dmg or 25% scaling per dustbolt, times three or 75% scaling per buffed E).
    $$x_e = (5*282*1.616 + 4*(282*1.966 + 3*125*1.616))/18 = 384.456$$
  </p><p>
    However, using Cyno's E every 2s interrupts the 5-hit NA sequence,
    so the damage from his NA will decrease (basically get halved since instead of having 4s to interweave you only have 2s).
    The rotation is much tighter, and in practice it is harder to play optimally with TF.
    With gilded, the na contributes most of the dps (370 out of 660).
    But when using TF, even if you gain 100 mv in the E you lose half of the mv from na or around 185 mv.
    So you actually lose more mv than what you gain, even if you adjust for dmg bonus.
    And this is assuming you are playing TF optimally, which is much harder.
    It is also assuming you have no other sources of dmg bonus,
    but in practice, Cyno has many options for dmg bonus, including Mona, Yelan, etc.
    which makes the 15% extra dmg bonus hit diminishing returns.
  </p><p>
    The buffed E contributes a significant portion of the damage, and TF can lead to a decrease in dust damage,
    which is why Gilded synergizes better with Cyno.
    Of course, among all the characters that can use TF, Cyno is probably the best character tailored for that set,
    but that does not mean TF is the best set for him.
    By contrast Gilded is a much more general set that works for many characters,
    but can still be bis for many.
  </p>


  <h3>Reactions</h3>
  <p>
    Above we ignored dmg from reactions.
    But the quicken reaction plays an important role in Cyno's dps.
    With gilded Cyno can reach 400 EM.
    With TF, he will have less EM (say 200 EM) and 20% increased aggravate damage.
  </p><p>
    With gilded the reaction bonus from aggravate is
    $$1+(5*400/1600) = 2.25$$
    With TF the reaction bonus is
    $$1+(5*200/1400)+.2 = 1.91$$
    That is, TF is worse when considering reactions. You get ripped off.
    The Genshin combat designers are smart and know that gilded is better.
  </p><p>
    Note most of Cyno's attacks have less scaling to accomodate the way additive reactions and bonuses work.
    Additive bonuses tend to give a bigger portion boost when the scalings are smaller.
    See <a href='elements.html'>elements</a> for details.
    Also because of ICD not every attack will trigger aggravate.
    Specifically, Cyno has normal 3 hit/2.5s icd on his na,
    his E mortuary rite has its own icd,
    and the three dust bolts have their own icd (and share icd).
    The dust bolts can usually always proc a reaction (since there are three of them).
  </p><p>
    It is true that quicken is a 'sticky' status, and its gauge can last several seconds.
    But currently if you want to consistently refresh quicken and proc aggravate throughout Cyno's 18s burst,
    you would need the DMC (15s q with C2) or Collei (up to 9s q).
    It is possible future dendro characters may also work.
  </p>


  <h3>Energy calculations</h3>
  <p>
    His E will also generate particles during his Q, so Cyno can function as a battery too (giving him support abilities).
    During his Q, an E will generate 4/3 particles on average.
    If he uses his E five times, it will generate 20/3 particles on average.
    So Cyno can gain 3*20/3 = 20 energy during his burst.
    If he has 130% ER then this becomes 26 energy,
    so his Q is effectively reduced from 80 to 54 cost.
  </p><p>
    Above we ignored electro resonance (which generates an extra electro particle when proccing reactions).
    Outside his Q, his E generates 3 particles.
    In practice, especially if Cyno is paired with another electro teammates or battery,
    it is very possible to get Cyno's burst back on cooldown.
  </p>

  <p>Overall, Cyno is a well-designed character, one of the best designed to date
    and much better designed than Ayaka.
    Cyno's EM scaling makes him synergize well with the new dendro element and quicken reaction.
    Being able to spam his E during his Q gives him battery properties and makes him like C6 Xiao.    
    His aoe is quite good. He has many weapon options to choose from.
    He is quite different from Raiden although both are electro polearm users.
    Whereas Raiden is more about energy generation, nuking, and quickswap,
    Cyno is more about on-field sustained dps and EM.
    Whereas Raiden focuses on Emblem and pure burst damage,
    Cyno cares more about EM and even his E damage.
    Moreover, Cyno synergizes with Beidou at least.
    The visuals and artistic design of the Egyptian Anubis are on point.
