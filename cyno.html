<title>Cyno</title>

  <p>
    Cyno is the poster character of Sumeru and featured in the Teyvat trailer.
    Cyno could be a reference to Cynocephaly or having the head of a jackal.    
    This features in Egyptian, Greek, and Roman mythology.
    In Egypt, cynocephaly is a characteristic of the gods Duamutef, Wepwawet (Ra), and Anubis.
  </p><p>
    Duamutef or the Golden Dawn is a guardian deity.
    Wepwawet is a god of war and wolf deity, and Cyno's constellation is called 金狼 meaning Golden Wolf.
    His outfit is like an Egyptian Pharoah's,
    and his headpiece does make him resemble Anubis.
    Anubis is the god of the underworld and has a canine head.
  </p><p>
    Cyno's title is Mahamatra, an Indian title established by emperor Ashoka and referring to an 'officer of morality'.
  </p>

  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>His q will give him electro infusion and EM. 
    It also gives interruption resistance and EC immunity (similar to Raiden q).
    In the last hit of his NA combo animation, he throws down a lightning bolt.
  </p><p>
    During his q, a circle will periodically flash on screen.
    With one of his passives, if he uses his e when the circle appears, it will increase the e dmg by 35%
    and fire three dustbolts (similar to Chongyun's c1 passive or Sara's q) that have 100% atk scaling each.
    The e does aoe damage.
  </p>
  <p>Using his e during his q can also extend the duration of his q.
    The q lasts a maximum of 18s.
  </p>

  <h2>Build</h2>
  <p>4p gilded is his bis given his EM scaling. 
    4p Thundering Fury (TF) for E spam, 2 TF 2 Gilded, 2 Gilded 2 WT, 4p glad for NA buff are also viable.
    There is no point in using Thundersoother when Mona and other ample dmg bonus sources exist for electro.
  </p><p>
    The Echo set is the worst set to use.
    When your career is based on the FBI backing you and attacking your political opponents,
    you deserve to be called the worst.
  </p><p>
    <s>Emblem is an interesting option (as is anything that buffs q damage).
    Emblem is Raiden's bis as most of her dmg is through her Q.
    Emblem can also buff Cyno's NA damage.</s>
    Unlike Raiden, Cyno works and synergizes well with Beidou.
    But at the same time, Emblem does not appear to work with Cyno.
    Besides Cyno also relies on E damage (including dustbolts), which emblem does not buff.
    On the other hand, TF focuses a bit too much on E.
    But Gilded's EM buff increases ALL of Cyno's damage (E and NA damage).
    So Gilded is the best and most comprehensive set for Cyno.
  </p>

  <h2>Weapons</h2>
  <p>Sand king is his bis by far. The EM to ATK conversion is quite high.
    PJWS is would be his next bis.
    Other good weapons are homa, catch, prototype, even white tassel.
    The kitain spear does give EM but the passive is kind of gimmicky, removing energy but then giving it back over time.
  </p>

  <h2>Teams</h2>
  <p>Technically Cyno can be used in any team Raiden is used in.
    This includes Cyno international (Cyno-Kujou-Bennett-Anemo), 
    Cyno rational (Cyno-XL-Yelan/XQ), Cyno-Eula, and Cyno-Yae.
    The Cyno rational becomes even more like Rational with Cyno's c4 which gives him battery abilities.
    Cyno-Eula also benefits from the c4 (though both Cyno and Eula take up on field time compared to Raiden).
  </p><p>
    Given Cyno's EM scaling he can also be built in aggravate comps (Cyno-Dendro).
    He can also be played on taser teams (electro-hydro-anemo).
  </p><p>
    Cyno synergizes with many different supports including:
    Beidou, Yae, Fischl, Sara, Candace, Yelan, XQ, XL, Dendro MC.
    He also benefits from Anemo vv and Bennett.
  </p><p>
    Other teams include: Cyno Beidou Yelan Bennett (Cyno fireworks) or Cyno Beidou XL Bennett.
