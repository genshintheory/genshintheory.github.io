  <p>
    Cyno is the poster character of Sumeru and featured in the Teyvat trailer.
    Cyno could be a reference to Cynocephaly or having the head of a jackal.    
    This features in Egyptian, Greek, and Roman mythology.
    In Egypt, cynocephaly is a characteristic of the gods Duamutef, Wepwawet (Ra), and Anubis.
  </p><p>
    Duamutef or the Golden Dawn is a guardian deity.
    Wepwawet is a god of war and wolf deity, and Cyno's constellation is called 金狼 meaning Golden Wolf.
    His outfit is like an Egyptian Pharoah's,
    and his headpiece does make him resemble Anubis.
    Anubis is the god of the underworld and has a canine head.
  </p><p>
    Cyno's title is Mahamatra, an Indian title established by emperor Ashoka and referring to an 'officer of morality'.

  <p>His q will give him electro infusion and EM. 
    It also gives interruption resistance and EC immunity (similar to Raiden q).
    In the last hit of his NA combo animation, he throws down a lightning bolt.
  </p><p>
    During his q, a circle will periodically flash on screen.
    With one of his passives, if he uses his e when the circle appears, it will increase the e dmg by 35%
    and fire three dustbolts (similar to Chongyun's c1 passive or Sara's q) that have 100% atk scaling each.
    The e does aoe damage.
