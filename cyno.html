<title>Cyno</title>

  <p>
    Cyno is the poster character of Sumeru and featured in the Teyvat trailer.
    Cyno could be a reference to Cynocephaly or having the head of a jackal.    
    This features in Egyptian, Greek, and Roman mythology.
    In Egypt, cynocephaly is a characteristic of the gods Duamutef, Wepwawet (Ra), and Anubis.
  </p><p>
    Duamutef or the Golden Dawn is a guardian deity.
    Wepwawet is a god of war and wolf deity, and Cyno's constellation is called 金狼 meaning Golden Wolf.
    His outfit is like an Egyptian Pharoah's,
    and his headpiece does make him resemble Anubis.
    Annubis is the god of the underworld and has a canine head.

    Cyno's title is Mahamatra, an Indian title established by emperor Ashoka and referring to an 'officer of morality'.
