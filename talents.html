<h2>Talent priority</h2>
<!-- <h2>Talent usage</h2> -->
<p>Some characters need their whole kit to function optimally.
  Others only use parts of their kit, with some talents not even being used at all.
  And then there are some characters that care most about their passive talents 
  (leveling their active talents not even necessary).
</p><p>
  This can happen when the character provides a special ability like crowd control or buff via passive.
  The introduction of dendro and hyperbloom has made it so 
  that many hyperbloom comps only need three elements to react to do damage (and could care less about talent level).
  This makes certain teams easy to build, if you do not have to care about talent level as much.
</p><p>
  Note most characters will use E and Q when played in teams (with few exceptions).
  Not every character will use their normal attack.
  Or even if they do use their normal attack, it may be just to drive reactions (such as Nahida NA for hyperbloom).
  <!-- However, the following focuses on which talents to level up that contribute most to the kit's dps. -->
</p>

<h2>Crowns</h2>
<p>Crowns are a somewhat limited resource in Genshin, with many obtained via limited time events.
  Table highlights which talents are worth crowning.
  We focus more on 5 star units.
  It is generally not recommended to crown 4 stars unless they are truly exceptional (e.g. Bennett Q).

<h2>Beyond lv10</h2>
<p>Some things in the game can increase talent levels beyond lv10.
    This includes constellations, Childe's passive, some event effects.
    Different characters benefit from boosting different talent levels beyond lv10.
    Some benefit from boosting all, while some only need to boost one or two.
  </p><p>
    If a character can only pick one or two talents to boost beyond lv10,
    then there are talents that have certain priorities to optimize overall dps.

<p>It is not necessarily true that C2 is the best or most important constellation.</p>
<ul>
<li>C6: Xiao, Dehya, Itto, Kazuha, Yae, Eula, Venti, 
  Childe (case can be made for C4 to unlock off-field),

</li>
<li>C1: Wrio, Noctis, Ganyu, hu tao</li>

  <!-- (difference between c0 and c6 not much): -->
  Zhongli, Albedo, Tartaglia, baizhu, Kokomi
