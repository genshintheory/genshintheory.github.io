<h2>C6 ranking</h2>
<p>This is focusing on the C6 itself, rather than assessing C0, C1, C2, ..., C6 altogether.
  For example, Raiden's C2/C3 is arguably more powerful than many C6 characters,
  but Raiden's C6 itself may not be as big an increase as her C3.
  But that does not change the fact that a C6 Raiden is just as powerful, if not more so than a C3 Raiden (although maybe not by much).
  Here we would be evaluating Raiden's C6 rather than a C6 Raiden.

<td>Diluc, Yoimiya, Raiden Shogun, Venti, Mona, Yelan, Yun Jin, 
  Jean (one of the few dmg reduction abilities, but her C4 is more broken), 
  Qiqi (can revive whole party), 
  Tartaglia (C6 while good may as well be a C1 effect like C1 Kazuha), 
  Beidou (-15% electro res), 
  Rosaria (-20% physical res), 
  Anemo Traveler (-20% anemo res), 
  Kujou Sara (one of few crit dmg buffs), 
  Gorou (one of few crit dmg buffs),
  Sucrose (similar to Kazuha passive),
  Kazuha, Xingqiu
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>A
</td>
<td>Bennett (infusion can mess up some characters), Chongyun, 
  Xiangling (15% dmg bonus does not buff own pyronado, XL's C4 is better), 
  Kaeya, Fischl, Thoma, 
  Albedo (C2 is better), 
  Yanfei, 
  Barbara (one of the few revival abilities), 
  Diona, Shikanoin Heizou
</td></tr>

</td>
<td>
Amber, Noelle, Ningguang, Lisa, Geo Traveler, Electro Traveler, Sayu, 
Xinyan (C6 would be better for someone like Itto), 
Kuki Shinobu, Razor, Kokomi
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>F (ripoffs if you need to spend money for this)
</td>
<td>Hu Tao, Ayaka, 
  Klee (C6 has battery properties),   
  Keqing (C6 gives limited dmg bonus), 
  Ayato (minimal dps increase 900/12 < 100 mv, not affected by namisen hp buff),
  Ganyu (C6 reduces charge time but does not increase dps by much compared to even C1, the worst C6), 
  Zhongli (shield heals but many Zhongli simps say healing is not needed when you have a shield),
  Tighnari (because E already reduces charge time, C6 does not do much),
  Dori (but Jean's passive already does a similar thing at C0)
</td></tr>

<h2>Other constellations</h2>
<p>Usually C6 stands out as the most powerful constellation in the kit.
  But sometimes earlier constellations can be very powerful as well.
  Some highlights include C2/C3 Raiden (ignore 60% def), C4 Jean (-40% anemo res), 
  Chongyun's C2 (reducing cd by 15% within e), 
  Xinyan's C2 (100% crit rate increase on q).
