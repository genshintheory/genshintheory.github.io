  <p>Faruzan is the best anemo buffer in the game, debuting in v3.3.
    She works in the Haravatat Darshan (one of the six Darshans of the Akademiya)
    and has been a herbad (mentor) for over a century.
    In some ruins she encountered something which stopped her from aging.
    She also like geometry.

  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>
    Her AA is called 'Parthian shot', which is also the name of a cavalry tactic used by the Parthians of Persia.
    The Parthian empire existed in Persia after Alexander's Hellenic empire.
  </p><p>
    After using her E (Nasamjnin), her next aimed shot will create a vortex that can clump enemies.
    It can also mark enemies (and allies) and create a vacuum vortex.
    With her passive, the arrow can also shred anemo res for 4s.
  </p><p>
    With her Q, she will create a polyhedron that releases whirlwind pulses,
    which reduce anemo res and buff anemo dmg bonus for nearby party members.
    Another passive buffs anemo addtivec damage based on 32% of Faruzan's base attack.
  </p>

  <h2>Teams</h2>
  <p>Faruzan can support anemo dps like Xiao and the new character Scaramouche.
    It looks like the game is getting an anemo buffer, similar to Shenhe (cryo), Gorou (geo), Sara (electro).
  </p>


  <h2>Review</h2>
  <p>Faruzan is the best anemo buffer in the game,
    and she is only a 4 star.
  </p><p>
    For one thing, the chad Faruzan shreds 30% anemo res at c0.
    By comparison, the virgin zhongli can only shred 20% even though he is a 5 star.
    To kick people when they are down even more, ganyu can only shred 15% cryo res with c1:
    ganyu as a 5 star needs constellations to do less than what Faruzan can do at c0!
  </p>
  <p>
    Faruzan is still and a top support for anemo dps like Xiao and Scaramouche.
    For Xiao specifically, Faruzan is almost a must for any optimal team 
    and is close to Bennett in terms of the overall buff she provides for Xiao.
  </p><p>
    Given Xiao's top dps, Faruzan is a game changer, 
    a true meta-reshaping support that brings Xiao to the next level.
    Who would have thought that it was possible to make a god go any higher.
