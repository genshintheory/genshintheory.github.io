<title>Faruzan</title>

  <p>Faruzan is the best anemo buffer in the game, debuting in v3.3.
    She works in the Haravatat Darshan (one of the six Darshans of the Akademiya)
    and has been a herbad (mentor) for over a century.
    In some ruins she encountered something which stopped her from aging.
    She also like geometry.

  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>
    Her AA is called 'Parthian shot', which is also the name of a cavalry tactic used by the Parthians of Persia.
    The Parthian empire existed in Persia after Alexander's Hellenic empire.
  </p><p>
    After using her E (Nasamjnin), she gains the manifest gale effect for 18s. 
    During this state, her next aimed shot (hurricane shot) will create a vortex that can clump enemies.
    It can also mark enemies (and allies) and create a vacuum vortex (pressurized collapse).
    With her passive, the pressurized collapse can also shred anemo res for 4s (applies perfidious wind), 
    and the charging time is reduced by 60%.
    The vacuum created by her CA will generate particles rather than her E tself.
  </p><p>
    With her Q, she will create a polyhedron that releases whirlwind pulses that shred anemo res and buff damage.
    Besides the initial Q hit, the polyhedron will move in a triangle, 
    dealing 6 whirlwind pulses over 12s (at C0) or one pulse every 2s.
    Each pulse will reduce anemo res (perfidious wind) and buff anemo dmg bonus for nearby party members (for 4s at a time).
    The pulse does not do damage itself.
    Another passive allows her Q to buff anemo additive damage based on 32% of Faruzan's base attack.
    Her Q lasts 12s at C0, which increases to 18s at C2.
  </p>

  <h2>Constellations</h2>
  <p>C1 allows her to fire two hurricane shots during her E manifest gale state.
    C2 extends Q duration by 6s to 18s.
    C4 gives energy.
    C6 gives 40% anemo crit dmg during Q and will allow characters to apply pressurized collapses (vacuum cc) on enemies every 3s.
  </p>

  <h2>Build</h2>
  <p>Faruzan wants ER for her 80 cost burst.
    Can use ER sands or ATK sands.
    Can also use 4p Emblem, Noblesse, etc.
  </p><p>
    Use ER weapons like Favonius bow or Elegy of the End.
    High base atk weapons can also work to buff her passive effect,
    but ER is more important.
  </p>

  <h2>Teams</h2>
  <p>Faruzan can support anemo dps like Xiao and the new character Scaramouche.
    It looks like the game is getting an anemo buffer, similar to Shenhe (cryo), Gorou (geo), Sara (electro).
  </p><p>
    The 4s debuff from her E can be used to buff Xiao's E and Scaramouche's Q.
    Otherwise Faruzan will need her Q.
    At C0, her 12s Q can support Scaramouche's E rotation (which is ~10s). 
    Given that the res shred and dmg bonus can linger for 4s, her Q can support Xiao too (12+4=16).
    At C2, her Q lasts longer, giving her more flexibility to support Xiao's 15s burst.
    At C6, she gives more cc on her Q as well as crit dmg, which is great for both Xiao and Scaramouche.
  </p><p>
    Because Xiao can get 2-3 charges on E, it is a bit easier for Xiao to battery Faruzan's 80 cost burst.
    Faruzan's res shred and crit dmg buff are good for both Xiao and Scaramouche.
    Faruzan's dmg bonus buff is a bit better for Scaramouche since Xiao gets much more dmg bonus already.
    The additive dmg bonus has a smaller effect than Faruzan's other buffs since Xiao and Scaramouche have high scalings on their NA/CA/PA.
    At C2, her burst lasting 18s is almost superfluous for Scaramouche and fits Xiao better.
    The 18s duration becomes better suited when Scaramouche has hydro infusion or C6 increasing his E duration.
  </p>


  <h2>Calculations</h2>
  <p>Faruzan Q gives 30% res shred, lv13 Q gives 38% anemo dmg bonus, C6 gives 40% anemo crit dmg.
    We ignore the 32% atk additive dmg buff as negligible.
    The res shred gives 1.22 times more damage.
    For 200% crit dmg, C6 gives 1.13 times more damage.
  </p><p>
    For Xiao plunges (for VH, 46.6+100 dmg bonus), the dmg bonus gives 1.26 times damage.
    Multiplying these three buffs gives 1.74 times more damage to Xiao plunges.    
  </p>
  <p>
    For Xiao E (46.6 dmg bonus ignoring passives), the dmg bonus gives 1.8 times damage.
    Multiplying these three buffs gives 2.5 times more damage to Xiao E.
    So C6 Faruzan can buff C6 Xiao by potentially more than 2 times (most of C6 Xiao's damage is via E).
    This is more than melt/vaporize, and it is more than Bennett.
    For a single character to more than double your damage is almost unreal in this game.
    And all of Faruzan's buffs are 'orthogonal' to Bennett's atk buff (which can give 1.5 times more damage).
    So if you multiply 2.5 by Bennett's buff you get 3.75 times more damage on Xiao E.
    So C6 Faruzan is the premium C6 Xiao support,
    and the above just shows that Faruzan takes the crown as the game's top buffer.
  </p><p>
    There was once a time in beta when Faruzan's Q gave 40% res shred and even more anemo dmg bonus.
  </p>
  <p>
    For Scaramouche (61.6 dmg bonus ignoring 4p sand king set), the dmg bonus gives 1.6 times damage.
    Multiplying these three buffs gives 2.2 times more damage.
    If Scaramouche activates the 4p sand set effect (giving 40% more dmg),
    the buff amount will be less (a bit more than 1.7 but less than 2.2).
  </p><p>
    C6 Faruzan is the best Xiao and Scaramouche buffer in game.
    For non-C6 Xiao, C6 Faruzan can buff Xiao and Scaramouche to similar amount 1.7 to 2.2 times.
    For C6 Xiao, C6 Faruzan can give a buff of up to 2.5 times.
    In this case, C6 Xiao needs Faruzan more.
  </p>


  <h2>Review</h2>
  <p>Faruzan is the best anemo buffer in the game,
    and she is only a 4 star.
  </p><p>
    For one thing, the chad Faruzan shreds 30% anemo res at c0.
    By comparison, the virgin zhongli can only shred 20% even though he is a 5 star.
    To kick people when they are down even more, ganyu can only shred 15% cryo res with c1:
    ganyu as a 5 star needs constellations to do less than what Faruzan can do at c0!
  </p>
  <p>
    Faruzan is still a top support for anemo dps like Xiao and Scaramouche.
    For Xiao specifically, Faruzan is almost a must for any optimal team 
    and is close to Bennett in terms of the overall buff she provides for Xiao.
  </p><p>
    Given Xiao's top dps, Faruzan is a game changer, 
    a true meta-reshaping support that brings Xiao to the next level.
    Who would have thought that it was possible to make a god go any higher.
  </p>


  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>Faruzan's name is a play on two Persian words:
    Foruzan (فُروزان), meaning shiny, and Farazana (فَرزان), meaning wise.
  </p>
  <p>Fatima (فَاطِمَة) was the daughter of Mohammad's and his wife Khadija (海迪彻).
    Fatima married Mohammad's son-in-law Ali ibn Abi Talib, the Rashidun caliph.
    Fatima and Ali had sons Hasan bin Ali and Alhusayn ibn Ali.
    Fatima was also known by her title Al-Mansura.
  </p><p>
    The 'Fa' sound is also used to tranliterate the Egyptian term pharoah (法老 falao) in Chinese.
    Incidentally, Fa and Lao refer to a certain incident in modern times...
