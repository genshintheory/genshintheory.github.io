  <p>Faruzan is a new anemo character that will debut in 3.3.
    She works in the Haravatat Darshan (one of the six Darshans of the Akademiya)
    and has been a herbad (mentor) for over a century.
    In some ruins she encountered something which stopped her from aging.

    <li>Chinese: Yan Mengmeng (阎萌萌)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>
    Her AA is called 'Parthian shot', which is also the name of a cavalry tactic used by the Parthians of Persia.
    The Parthian empire existed in Persia after Alexander's Hellenic empire.
  </p><p>
    After using her E (Nasamjnin), her next aimed shot will create a vortex that can clump enemies.
    It can also mark enemies (and allies) and create a vacuum vortex.
    With her passive, the arrow can also shred anemo res.
  </p><p>
    With her Q, she will create a polyhedron that releases whirlwind pulses,
    which reduce anemo res and buff anemo dmg to nearby party members.
    Another passive buffs anemo damage based on Faruzan's base attack.
  </p>

  <h2>Teams</h2>
  <p>Faruzan can support anemo dps like Xiao and the new character Scaramouche.
    It looks like the game is getting an anemo buffer, similar to Shenhe (cryo), Gorou (geo), Sara (electro).
