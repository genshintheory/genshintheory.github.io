<p>Version 3.5 introduced Dehya and Mika.
  It features the Windblume event, which has a pacman event.
  It also contains a new Faruzan hangout and archon quest Caribert.
  </p>


  <h2>Windblume festival</h2>
  <p>During the windblume festival,
    Cyno shows off his joke-telling skills.
    The way Cyno explains his puns in great detail
    is kind of similar to how this site explains various things in Genshin in great detail.
    The difference is that Cyno deals with jokes,
    whereas this site deals with more serious stuff.
    Not everything here is a laughing matter.
  </p><p>
    Cyno also travels to Mondstadt to advertise the TCG some more.
