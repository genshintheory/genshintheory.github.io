    <title>Version 3.5</title>

  <div id="includedContent"></div>


<p>Version 3.5 introduced Dehya and Mika.
  It features the Windblume event, which has a pacman event.
  It also contains a new Faruzan hangout and archon quest Caribert.
  </p>

  <h2>Caribert / Charibert</h2>
  <p>Name could refer to Charibert, the king of Paris in the 500s, around the time the Huns invaded Europe.</p>
  <p>The quest starts in Port Ormos, Sumeru. The traveler has a drink with <a href=kaeya.html>Kaeya</a>, the Diluc main, 
    and Dainsleif, the bough-keeper.
    The conversation between Kaeya and Dainsleif sounds like someone talking to himself...
    We learn that Kaeya Alberich descends from the founder of the Abyss Order
    and that Dainsleif is a pure-blooded Khaenriah person.
    So if Alberich founded the Abyss Order, and the traveler's sibling is their ruler,
    would that make the traveler's sibling the ancestor of Kaeya?
    An amusing thought, but not necessarily...
  </p>


  <h2>Windblume festival</h2>
  <p>During the windblume festival,
    Cyno shows off his joke-telling skills.
    The way Cyno explains his puns in great detail
    is kind of similar to how this site explains various things in Genshin in great detail.
    The difference is that Cyno deals with jokes,
    whereas this site deals with more serious stuff.
    Not everything here is a laughing matter.
  </p><p>
    Cyno also travels to Mondstadt to advertise the TCG some more.
  </p>
    <p>Eula also appears for the festival, but for some reason did not rerun in 3.5... 
    even though her support Mika debuted in 3.5...
    </p><p>
      Search up the word 'entrapment'. 
      The USA FBI and CIA does it a lot for the sake of smear campaigns and character assassination.
