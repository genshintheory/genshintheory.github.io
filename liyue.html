<p>The so-called 'Liyue Big Three' of Xiao, Ganyu, Hu Tao
  is a possible reference to three of the biggest victims of Zhu during the Ming dynasty.
  Xiao is a nod to Fang Xiaoru.
  Ganyu is a nod to Lan Yu (Yelan is also a nod to Lan Yu).
  Hu Tao is a nod to Hu Weiyong.

<h2>Morax</h2>
<p>In his first story quest, we meet an archaeologist named Wanyan (also the name of the ruling house of the Jurchen Jin 金 dynasty).
  We learn that the God of Salt, Havria, was murdered by her own people as she was too weak to defend them during the Archon War.
  We also beat up a Fatui named Kliment.
</p><p>
  The people encased in salt are reminiscent of the splicers from Bioshock.
</p>


<h2>Azhdaha</h2>
<p>Azhdaha (اژدها) refers to a kind of dragon in Iranian mythology.
  In Genshin, Azhdaha debuted as a boss in 1.5 
  (the yin / evil side reincarnated as Jiu and the yang / benevolent side reincarnated as Kun Jun).
  In the game, Azhdaha is translated as 若陀龙王 in Chinese.
  Here 若陀 retuo could be a transliteration of the Sanskrit term jñatā (ज्ञता), meaning knowledge, 
  befitting of Sumeru, the nation of knowledge.
  The fact that Azhdaha dwells beneath the dragon queller, near the Chasm and Sumeru,
  reinforces this connection between Liyue and Sumeru via the ancient Aryan and Buddhist culture.
</p><p>
  Knowledge is sometimes translated as jñāna (ज्ञान) in Sanskrit, transliterated as 若那 rena in Chinese.
  The Chinese word for knowledge is 智 zhi.
  The words jnana, zhi are similar to / cognate with gignoskein (Greek), znat (Russian), 
  know (English), knowledge, gnosis, etc.
</p><p>
  The Azhdaha creature is described more in Persian literature such as the Shahnameh.

<h2>Undetected Filtration (v2-6)</h2>
<p>In this quest we follow Yanbo to beat up treasure hoarders, including Zhao Tieniu.
  Whoever designed this quest and used actual names of people
  should make a quest where Emperor Han Wudi Liu Che, Consort Wei Zifu, or General Li Guangli get beaten up as well:
  as in they get turned into treasure hoarders, and we have to beat them up.
</p><p>
  This quest is one of many reasons why version 2.6 is one of the worst versions in Genshin's history.
