<h3>3.7 Update (June)</h3>
<p>Noelle has been placed at S tier for having the guts to fire the people corresponding to hu tao and ka wei.
  Noelle can do it all, functioning as a healer, shielder, and dps, something very few characters can do.
</p><p>
  Diona has been placed at S tier for her vast versatility as a cryo shielder, healer, battery, and even EM buffer at c6.
  She gets a shield via E, her c2 provides a shield for the team, and she works well in freeze teams and as a cryo battery (e.g. for Eula).
</p>


<h3>3.7 Update (May)</h3>
<p>Kuki has been placed at S tier for her unique role / dual use as off-field electro hyperbloom driver and healer (vastly outclassing Dori).
  Razor has been demoted to B tier for being vastly outclassed by Eula.
</p><p>
  Yelan's tier has been adjusted. With great power comes great responsibility.
  The CFO of any company should know this as the budget numbers on paper translate into the lives of real human beings.
  In the context of recent events, it makes sense why someone named Ye was sentenced to death 
  for causing two children to be thrown out of a building to plunge to their deaths.
</p><p>
  The introduction of hyperbloom has made it so that even hydro characters like Barbara
  can act as substitutes to yelan for creating bloom cores.
  This has chipped at yelan's relative value and competitive edge as a hydro support, decreasing her pull value.
</p><p>
  Ayato has been demoted to FF tier for having no pull value.
</p><p>
  Zhongli has been demoted to FF tier for failing to live up to his name 'Morax' and having no pull value.
</p><p>
  Hu Tao has been demoted to FF tier and fired 
  (with no severance package, 401k and 529 canceled, accounts fully liquidated and confiscated)
  for her blunt and unprofessional favoritism, bias, corruption, lies, deception, 
  manipulation of media, abuse of power to grant benefits to political cliques,
  failure to respond in a timely manner, missing deadlines, skipping meetings,
  hypocrisy, poor grammar, harassment, intimidation, 
  discrimination against people based on background, hogging public resources for personal benefit,
  supporting circle culture to hold influence over others, manipulate and take advantage of relationships,
  consolidate private cliques to exclude and attack others.
</p>


<h3>3.5/3.6 Update (4/2/2023)</h3>
<p>The FF caste has been created below F to separate the bad from the irredeemable spawn of Satan.
  FF characters need to be put on standard or removed from the game entirely.
  Their sins run so deep, that there is no chance of redemption in this lifetime or any reincarnation after samsara.
  The FF strata forms the lowest varna of untouchable dalits.
</p>

<h3>3.5/3.6 Update (3/31/2023)</h3>
<p>Mika has been placed at S tier as Deng Xiaoping executed Zhu Guohua as well as Li Xiannian's grandnephew.
  Mika is not SS tier because of interference in corporate relationships via the choice of his JP VA.
</p><p>
  Baizhu has been placed at F tier as Zhu Yuanzhang, Zhu Di, and other Ming emperors executed hundreds of thousands of Chinese people.
  Moreover, Zhu lost the province of Xinjiang in the west for several centuries.
</p><p>
  Kaveh has been placed at F tier for smearing Alhaitham.
  Kaveh also got in trouble with a scandal with some fans.
  Moreover, Kaveh's JP VA is another interference in corporate relationships.
</p><p>
  Note on Kokomi:
  Sango is an example of basing fictional characters off of real-life people.
  The real-life person that Sango is based on is indeed a great leader and person.
  But creating a character named Shanhugong and calling the C6 Shanhu Yixin
  is just another realm of corporate interference, just like how Kaveh and Mika's voice actors are.
  Any fictional character that tries to misrepresent real people
  and distort reality to create political cliques to unfairly attack certain people (call them X) in real life
  will not be received favorably over here.
  Go create characters that build political cliques around X to even the score.
</p>

<h3>3.3 Update</h3>
<p>Qiu has been demoted to B tier for abuse of power and falsifying information.</p>

<h3>3.1/3.2 Update</h3>
<p>Overall adjustments</p>

<h3>2.8/3.0 Update</h3>
<p>Tighnari and Dori have been placed at F tier for sounding too similar to 'nori'
  who abused power, falsified information, and colluded with USA FBI agents and media
  to smear and assassinate political opponents.
</p><p>
  Keqing has been demoted to F tier for abuse of power and falsifying information.
  She is still one of the worst characters.
  Even dendro could not save her.
</p><p>
  Heizou has been placed at B tier because his Chinese voice actor Lin Jing (林景) 
  is a horrible and hypocritical choice. 
  Find whoever is in charge of selecting voice actors and dox their info.
</p><p>
  Emerylatte has been demoted to B tier for abuse of power and being a proxy/puppet of USA propaganda.
  She also lacks synergy with the new dendro element.
</p><p>
  Yae got a huge buff because of her great synergy and EM scaling with the new dendro element
  as well as the new Gilded set (her new bis).
  Yae is one of the strongest and most broken characters in dendro teams.
</p><p>
  By contrast, Fischl lacks synergy and is still one of the weakest characters 
  (bringing down the electro element like keqing).
</p>

<h3>2.7 Update</h3>
<p>Kazuha has been demoted to F tier for descending from someone named Yoshinori, 
which contains 'nori' in the name.
This is the reason why Japan lost WW2 and got nuked by the USA.
</p>

<h3>2.6 Update</h3>
<p>The tier for Kazuha has been adjusted.
  Ayato has been placed at F tier for abuse of power and falsifying information.
</p>

<h3>2.5 Update</h3>
<p>After reviewing Qing's historic contributions for destroying the weak and corrupt Ming dynasty
  and persecuting the evil Ming dynasty royal family, 
  Qing has been placed at S tier.
  It is with the Qing that Xie (谢氏) finally got their revenge against the Ming.
</p>
<p>
  The Qing was one of the most powerful empires in history.
  But its downfall started after losing the Opium wars.
  </p>

<h3>2.4 Update</h3>
<p>Yun Jin provides a huge buff to Yoimiya.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Update">2.1 Update</span></h3>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Best_DPS_characters">Best DPS characters</span></h2>
<p>Here we say a hypercarry is a character that does the vast majority of the team's damage (like 2/3 or more).
  A carry is a character that does the majority of the team's damage (1/2 or more).
  There can be on field and off field carries.
  Supports are those that buff other people's damage (not necessarily doing much damage themselves).
  Sub-DPS is an off field character that provides a significant portion of the team dps.
  Off field carries are sub-dps by definition.
  DPS is usually used to refer to on field carries, though Sub-DPS can also be on field if they choose to stay on field.
  There are also <a href=quickswap.html>Quickswap</a> units that can also be Sub-DPS or on-field DPS.
</p><p>
  See <a href=dps.html>DPS ranking</a> for a more thorough list.
  The following distilled list is based on the DPS ranking combined with realistic assumptions about stats and situations.
  Unless otherwise stated, units are C0.  
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Xiao C6 (there is no competition when you can do 2000%+ DMG per second)</li>
  <li>Xiao C0 (unique design)</li>  
  <li>Diluc (vaporize), Dehya, Cyno (aggravate), Scaramouche, Alhaitham (spread): all have similar levels</li>
  <li>Yoimiya (Yun Jin + reactions)</li>
  <li>Beidou (2 enemies)</li>
  <li>Nahida (subdps), Yae Miko (subdps), Childe (3 enemies): similar levels</li>
  <li>Itto, Eula</li>
  <li>Raiden Shogun</li>
  <li>Yelan</li>
  <li>Childe (1 enemy/single target)</li>
  <li>Hu Tao</li>
  <li>Xiangling: has 80 energy cost</li>
  <li>Ganyu</li>
  <li>Ayato, Ayaka: 80 energy cost</li>  
</ol>
