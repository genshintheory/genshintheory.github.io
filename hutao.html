    <p>Hu Tao is Zhongli's boss at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.</p>
    <h1>Calculations</h1>
    <p>We assume level 10 autoattack and E.
      We assume that she has 30000 HP, so that her E gives her around 2000 extra ATK.
      We assume this bumps her attack to around 3000.
      Other characters can reach 3000 ATK by using Bennett.
      On the other hand, most of Hu Tao's optimal teams do not use Bennett as she will lose some of her other damage bonuses if she is paired with Bennett, who often heals her above 50%.
      So for simplicity we will ignore the effect of ATK on these calculations.
    </p>
    <p>We assume that she can spam her CA 8 times within 9 seconds. Each CA is preceded by 1 NA, so it will be 8 N1C1 combos.
      The CA have no ICD (or short enough) whereas the NA have normal ICD.
      We assume that she can vaporize each CA and will ignore any vaporizations on her NA.
      The skill has a 16 second cooldown.
      We assume she has a Pyro DMG Bonus goblet with at least 2 piece Crimson and that she is under 50% HP so she gets an additional 33% DMG Bonus.
      The total DMG Bonus she gets is then \(46.6+15+33 = 94.6%\).
      The DPS is
    </p>
    <dl><dd>\(x_{C0} = 8*1.946*(1.5*242.57 + 83.65)/16 = 435.422365 \)</dd></dl>
    <p>This is higher than Xiangling and Ganyu's DPS but lacks AoE. However it is lower than Eula, Raiden, and Xiao's DPS.
      Hu Tao's burst will not contribute much relatively to her dps given its 15 second cooldown and lower scaling than Eula's burst.
    </p><p>
    With Hu Tao's C1, she can spam her CA up to 10 times by using dash canceling tricks. This increases her dps by \(10/8 = 1.25\) times
    bringing it up to</p>
  <dl><dd>\(x_{C1} = 544.25\)</dd></dl>
    <p>This is potentially higher than C0 Eula and C0 Raiden's DPS, but still lower than C0 Xiao's DPS.</p>
