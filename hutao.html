    <p>Hu Tao is Zhongli's boss at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.</p>

    <h1>Calculations</h1>
    <p>We assume level 10 autoattack and E.
      We assume that she has 30000 HP, so that her E gives her around 2000 extra ATK.
      We assume this bumps her attack to around 3000.
      Other characters can reach 3000 ATK by using Bennett.
      On the other hand, most of Hu Tao's optimal teams do not use Bennett as she will lose some of her other damage bonuses if she is paired with Bennett, who often heals her above 50%.
      So for simplicity we will ignore the effect of ATK on these calculations.
    </p>
    <p>We assume that she can spam her CA 8 times within 9 seconds. Each CA is preceded by 1 NA, so it will be 8 N1C1 combos.
      The CA have no ICD (or short enough) whereas the NA have normal ICD.
      We assume that she can vaporize each CA and will ignore any vaporizations on her NA.
      The skill has a 16 second cooldown.
      We assume she has a Pyro DMG Bonus goblet with at least 2 piece Crimson and that she is under 50% HP so she gets an additional 33% DMG Bonus.
      The total DMG Bonus she gets is then \(46.6+15+33 = 94.6%\).
      The DPS is
    </p>
    <dl><dd>\(x_{C0} = 8*1.946*(1.5*242.57 + 83.65)/16 = 435.422365 \)</dd></dl>
    <p>This is higher than Xiangling and Ganyu's DPS but lacks AoE. However it is lower than Eula, Raiden, and Xiao's DPS.
      Hu Tao's burst will not contribute much relatively to her dps given its 15 second cooldown and lower scaling than Eula's burst.
    </p><p>
    With Hu Tao's C1, she can spam her CA up to 10 times by using dash canceling tricks. This increases her dps by \(10/8 = 1.25\) times
    bringing it up to</p>
  <dl><dd>\(x_{C1} = 544.25\)</dd></dl>
    <p>This is potentially higher than C0 Eula and C0 Raiden's DPS, but still lower than C0 Xiao's DPS.</p>
    <p>Perhaps most surprising (or not) is that C1 Hu Tao has less DPS than a C0 Diluc.</p>

    <h1>Why Diluc is stronger than Hu Tao</h1>
    <p>C0 Diluc has higher dps than C1 Hu Tao, which may come as an embarrassing surprise.
      It turns out the USA propaganda has done an extreme job of overhyping Hu Tao.
      There are legit reasons based on mv calculation and analysis:
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li>Diluc attacks faster</li>
    <li>Hu Tao has downtime (cooldown on her E is 7 seconds), whereas Diluc does not really have any downtime</li>
    <li>Diluc has a better artifact set, taking advantage of crimson 4 piece much better than Hu Tao</li>
    <li>Diluc has better AoE</li>
    <li>Diluc does not sacrifice hp for buffs</li>
    <li>Diluc synergizes better with Bennett than Hu Tao</li>
    <li>Diluc can more easily use vv res shred. Before Thoma, Hu Tao did not really have any convenient way to use the vv shred from anemo units because the way her pyro application works (forces her to stay on field).</li>
    <li>Diluc has higher base atk.</li>
    <li>Diluc does not consume as much stamina as Hu Tao (for C0). The fact that Hu Tao needs C1 to not consume stamina and still do less DPS than Diluc is quite sad.</li>
    <li>Basically any Hu Tao team can replace Hu Tao with Diluc, but the converse is not true.
    In Diluc Bennett teams, it is not necessarily better to replace Diluc with Hu Tao since Hu Tao has anti-synergy with Bennett.
    So Diluc is a much more flexible unit when it comes to team building.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Before the Hu Tao simps go malding, have a meltdown, and off themselves like Hu Tao does with her HP, 
  Hu Tao has the following</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Better c1</li>
    <li>Better weapon (as of Version 2.4): homa, whereas there is not really any good 5 star crit claymore for Diluc (redhorn base atk too low and passive is copium for Diluc)</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
  However besides the first constellation, c2-6 for Diluc are better than c2-c6 for Hu Tao.
  Funny thing is that c1 is a pretty decent upgrade for Hu Tao
  but it is still worse than c0 Diluc.
  Why does the USA media hype Hu Tao? Politics.
  </p>
  <p>
  Overhyping c1 Hu Tao is one of the biggest scams committed by the USA media. 
  They and their proxies need to pay reparations for their crimes.
  </p>
  <p>
  As it stands, Diluc still reigns as the top Pyro DPS.
  </p>

  <h1>Note on Thoma</h1>
  <p>When Thoma debuted in Version 2.2, the USA media made a big deal, saying how Thoma is such a good upgrade for Hu Tao
    since he can shield and apply pyro so that Hu Tao can make use of the -40% RES from Anemo VV.
    While objectively speaking, Thoma is a better support than Zhongli for Hu Tao specifically 
    (VV shred provides bigger buff than Zhongli shred, Thoma also provides Pyro resonance and particles for Hu Tao),
    it is not like a pyro shielder did not exist before.
    Even before Thoma came out, Xinyan (with a Sacrificial Greatsword) could act as a Pyro applicator and shielder for Hu Tao.
    That said, Thoma's overall abilities, passives, and constellations probably suit Hu Tao more
    whereas Xinyan's buffs to physical damage do not benefit Hu Tao.
  </p><p>
    Some people have also said that you can use Yanfei's C4 shield for Hu Tao.
    However, you only get the shield with Yanfei's C4, and you have to use her burst to trigger it.
    Yanfei has an 80 energy cost burst, which is quite expensive for just a shield,
    so having a shield on an E ability is more convenient for Hu Tao.
