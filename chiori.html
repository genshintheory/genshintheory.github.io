<title>Chiori</title>

  </head>
  
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>


  <p>We can read Chinese and Japanese characters,
    so we know that Chiori's name is Qianzhi (千织)
    and that her Japanese VA is Zhuda Cainai (竹達彩奈).
    We have noticed that whenever Zhu appears in the banner, 3.6 and 4.2, something bad happens.
    Seeing how Chiori may appear in 4.5
    and that her other voice actors will be revealed in the 4.5 SP,
    we fear that something bad will happen on the day of the 4.5 SP.
    We want to preempt anything bad from happening.
    We can guess what kinds of tricks the planners want to pull off when 4.5 SP hits and Chiori is revealed,
    but we do not want anything bad to happen,
    especially to future characters.
  </p><p>
    We also noticed that Zhongli gained a new title Deus Auri (in 4.2) and that this was added in the Oathsworn Eye.
    Given that Zhongli's VA is Peng Bo, allegedly one of the VA directors, we do not think this title is suitable for a leader
    as it is clearly meant to make political attacks on others.
    'Golden God' is a better translation than forcing the Latin on to Zhongli.
  </p><p>
    Moreover, we remember that Dehya's banner was named Auric Blaze
    and that Cyno's constellation was named Lupus Aurus.
    We are aware that Au is the symbol for Gold and that Gold (金 Jin) translates into Aur in Latin.
    However, we have noticed that certain translators like playing games,
    using Gold in some cases and Aur in other cases.
  </p><p>
    Seeing how Chiori's voice actors will be revealed in 4.5 SP and that Zhu is one of them,
    combined with this past pattern of Aur, we can almost guess what kind of trick certain people will pull as well as the political attack they may make.
  </p><p>
    We are strongly opposed to this kind of repetitive translation that is clearly meant to make political attacks and contain people.
    We do not want to see things like this in the future either.
  </p><p>
    And we can already guess who Chiori's other voice actors are,
    so we are preparing for the worst case scenario.
  </p>

  <h1>Bennett's birthday gift</h1>
  <p>We know that February 29 is Bennett's birthday.
    It is also when Genshin will start that 4.4 hilichurl event that uses the Upano eye against hilichurls.
    Moreover, it seems the 4.5 SP will be the day after,
    and that is when Chiori's voice actors will be revealed, alongside Zhuda.
    It is very easy to guess what kind of nasty thing will happen on Bennett's birthday,
    something that only comes around once every 4 years.
    If we can learn from what happened on Beidou and Alhaitham's birthdays this year,
    we can imagine something nasty will happen due to certain people's prejudices.
  </p>

  <p>Some other notes: Keep the names Thomas and Ivan in mind...
    February 29 is when Sparkle and Jing Yuan's banners start.
    It is also when the Dreamjolt TV event starts.
    Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth also releases on February 29, featuring Cloud, Tifa.
  </p><p>
    Beware of the USA FBI creating fake accounts or going on a rampage.
    March 3 is Qiqi's birthday.
    Overflowing Mastery will start.
    March 14 (pi day) is Jean's birthday.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moreover, we have taken a keen interest into Honkai Star Rail's treatment of
    Topaz, Argenti, Acheron, Black Swan,
    and we do not like what we see.
    We have also compared this to the treatment of Fu Xuan, Dr. Ratio, and Navia.
    One does not need a PhD in Statistics to detect that there is extreme bias going on here,
    with a p value close to 0 being significant at the \(\alpha = 10^{-69}\) level.
  </p>
  <p>What is with these personal attacks / microaggressions. 
    This is as close to libel and defamation as one can get.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have also noticed that various organizations in the USA have invited certain speakers 
    related to Michael and Argenti to give talks around February 29, Bennett's birthday.
    We do not like the political message that is being sent.
  </p>

  <p>We need Arlecchino's base Defense and HP to be higher than Xiao (Alatus).
    Otherwise, it would be worse than the death penalty and we believe 4.4/4.5 should be the last version to release in Genshin's history.
    Otherwise, we don't think 4.6 should ever release.
    Genshin has had its run for 3 years.
  </p>

  <p>
    Why do we need Arlecchino's def / hp higher than Xiao?
    Look at Argenti's base stats and compare them to Dr. Ratio's stats.
    Now look at Huangquan's stats and compare them to Ratio.
    Now look at Xiao, Navia... no we do not even want to spell it out. No. NOOO! It is too horrible to think about it, worse than the death penalty.
    We do not want anything bad to happen.
    Now when you see various USA organizations inviting 'Michael' to give talks around February 29, Bennett's birthday,
    it does not take a genius or PhD to put two and two together on the USA's political agenda.
  </p>

  <p>Arlecchino has a long future ahead of her. 
    We need Arlecchino's def or hp to be higher than Xiao.
    Otherwise, she would be crippled and disabled for life.
    We don’t want her to be another crippled victim like how Argenti, Swan, and Huangquan were crippled by the butcher Jiang of honkai star rail.
    Otherwise, if Genshin's intent is to embarass, defame, and humiliate her, it would be a life worse than the death penalty.
  </p><p>
    Even Wriothesley has higher hp than Xiao.
    Childe, Kazuha have higher hp and def than Xiao.
    Shenhe has higher hp / def than Xiao.
    Ayato has higher hp than Xiao.
    Keqing has higher hp than Xiao and same def.
    Cyno has higher def than Xiao.
    Alhaitham has higher hp than Xiao.
    Diluc has higher hp than Xiao.
    Itto, Qiqi, Albedo have higher def than Xiao. In fact Itto has higher hp and def than Xiao.
    Navia has... 
  </p><p>
    You already gave Navia, Ratio, Fu Xuan such high stats.
    We need Arlecchino to have at least one stat higher than each other character. 
    Otherwise, you don't need to release Arlecchino. You don't need to release 4.6 at all. 
    It would be worse than the death penalty.
