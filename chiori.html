<title>Chiori</title>

  </head>
  
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>


  <p>We can read Chinese and Japanese characters,
    so we know that Chiori's name is Qianzhi (千织)
    and that her Japanese VA is Zhuda Cainai (竹達彩奈).
    We have noticed that whenever Zhu appears in the banner, 3.6 and 4.2, something bad happens.
    Seeing how Chiori may appear in 4.5
    and that her other voice actors will be revealed in the 4.5 SP,
    we fear that something bad will happen on the day of the 4.5 SP.
    We want to preempt anything bad from happening.
    We can guess what kinds of tricks the planners want to pull off when 4.5 SP hits and Chiori is revealed,
    but we do not want anything bad to happen,
    especially to future characters.
  </p><p>
    We also noticed that Zhongli gained a new title Deus Auri (in 4.2) and that this was added in the Oathsworn Eye.
    Given that Zhongli's VA is Peng Bo, allegedly one of the VA directors, we do not think this title is suitable for a leader
    as it is clearly meant to make political attacks on others.
    'Golden God' is a better translation than forcing the Latin on to Zhongli.
  </p><p>
    Moreover, we remember that Dehya's banner was named Auric Blaze
    and that Cyno's constellation was named Lupus Aurus.
    We are aware that Au is the symbol for Gold and that Gold (金 Jin) translates into Aur in Latin.
    However, we have noticed that certain translators like playing games,
    using Gold in some cases and Aur in other cases.
  </p><p>
    Seeing how Chiori's voice actors will be revealed in 4.5 SP and that Zhu is one of them,
    combined with this past pattern of Aur, we can almost guess what kind of trick certain people will pull as well as the political attack they may make.
  </p><p>
    We are strongly opposed to this kind of repetitive translation that is clearly meant to make political attacks and contain people.
    We do not want to see things like this in the future either.
  </p><p>
    And we can already guess who Chiori's other voice actors are,
    so we are preparing for the worst case scenario.
