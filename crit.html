<p>Among dps characters, some ascend with crit rate and some ascend with crit damage.
  By default most characters start with 5% crit rate and 50% crit damage.
  Crit rate characters can reach 24.2% crit rate at level 80-90,
  whereas crit damage characters can reach 88.4% crit damage at level 80-90.
</p><p>
  From these base values alone, crit rate characters have an inherent advantage over crit damage characters.
  The formula for expected crit multiplier is
  $$x = 1+rd$$
  where r is the cr and d is the cd.
  For crit rate characters (without weapons, artifacts, etc.) they can naturally get 24.2% cr and 50% cd,
  so \(x = 1+.242*.5 = 1.121.\)
  By contrast, crit damage characters naturally get 5% cr and 88.4% cd so \(x = 1+.05*.884 = 1.0442.\)
  In other words, without extra weapons/artifacts/passives/supports buffing the character,
  crit rate characters can naturally have a higher expected crit multiplier than crit damage characters.
</p><p>
  Sure when you crit, the number may be higher if you have higher crit damage, 
  but what's the use in having high crit damage if you can't crit in the first place?
  That's why having crit rate is important.
