  <h2>Asta in Genshin</h2>
  <p>Asta E does bounce damage that hits up to 5 enemies.
    For each enemy hit, Asta increases all party members' atk by 10%.
    Effect lasts 15s. E cd is 10s.
    This alone can make Asta broken in aoe situations, a kind of Bennett but with E.
    But in single target scenarios, it is just 10% atk.
    So it is balanced.
  </p><p>
    Now Genshin speed is different from the speed in the turn-based HSR.
    Instead of buffing speed/advancing action,
    in Genshin, Asta Q can reduce all party members' E and Q cd by 5s.
    Or reduce all cd by 20%.
    And the effect can last 25s.
  </p>
  <p>There are not too many abilities in the game that reduce the team's whole cd.
    There is anemo resonance (5% cd reduction) and Raiden c6.
    But Asta can be a unique kind of support in Genshin, with the role of cd reducer and atk buffer.
