<title>Fatui</title>

  </head>
  
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  <p>The <b>Fatui</b> (愚人众) are one of the main factions in Genshin Impact. They hail from Snezhnaya.
    One of their missions is to collect gnosis from the archons in an attempt to overthrow the gods.
    They swear their allegiance to the Tsaritsa, the cryo archon.
  </p>

  <h2>Members</h2>
  <p>Genshin gave quite a surprise with a new video (冬夜愚戏) revealing the Fatui Harbingers (July 12, 2022).
    A number of characters appear in the video, including the new Dendro characters.
    Their names (and Chinese voice actors with translations) are as follows:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Pierro, the "Jester", 1st of the Fatui Harbingers and the commander: Fu Chong. 愚人众统括官「丑角」皮耶罗——符冲</li>
    <li>Colombina: Yang Menglu (also Kujou Sara's CV). 愚人众执行官「少女」哥伦比娅——杨梦露</li>
    <li>Pulcinella: Wang Xiaobing. 愚人众执行官「公鸡」普契涅拉——王肖兵</li>
    <li>Pantalone: Xu Min. 愚人众执行官「富人」潘塔罗涅——徐敏</li>
    <li>Arlecchino: Huang Ying. 愚人众执行官「仆人」阿蕾奇诺——黄莺</li>
    <li>Tartaglia/Childe: Li Chunyin/Yu Dong. 愚人众执行官「公子」达达利亚——李春胤（鱼冻）</li>
    <li>Sandrone: Hong Haitian. 愚人众执行官「木偶」桑多涅——洪海天</li>
    <li>Capitano: Wang Wei. 愚人众执行官「队长」卡皮塔诺——王玮</li>
    <li>Dottore: Wu Lei. 愚人众执行官「博士」多托雷——吴磊</li>
    <li>Collei: Qin Wenjing. 柯莱——秦文静</li>
    <li>Tighnari: Mo Ran. 提纳里——莫然</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Scaramouche (散兵) is also mentioned in the video. 
    From the in-game story, he is supposedly based on an old prototype of the Raiden Shogun.
  </p><p>
    La Signora/Rosalyn (#8 of the Harbingers) was executed by the <a href='raidenshogun.html'>Raiden Shogun</a> in Inazuma.
    That's revenge for abusing <a href='venti.html'>Venti</a>.
  </p>
  <p>The character names are based on the Italian comedy <i>Commedia dell'arte</i>.</p>

  <p>From the Genshin manhua, Collei has a past history with Dottore and his experiments.
    Moreover, <a href='diluc.html'>Diluc</a> once had an encounter with Dottore in Mondstadt.
  </p>

  <h2>Combat</h2>
  <p>As of 2.8 Tartaglia is the only playable Fatui Harbinger.
    In 2.1, Rosalyn got executed.
    This raises the question:
    will future Fatui Harbingers be playable as well? Or will they suffer the same fate as La Signora?
  </p><p>
    Moreover what are their elements?
    Many of them have delusions and appear to be able to control multiple elements simultaneously.
    For example, Childe can control hydro and electro.
    La Signora can control cryo and pyro.
  </p><p>
    It is presumed that Scaramouche can control electro.
    And it appears that Dottore controls cryo based on the color of his outfit?
    But this is just speculation and subject to change.
