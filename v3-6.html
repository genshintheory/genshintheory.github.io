  <p>The rumored TCG cards to be released refer to victims of Zhu.
    Arataki (Huanglong) refers to Huang Zicheng, who was executed by Zhu Di.
    Ayato refers to Zhao Yong, Zhao Mao, and others who were executed by Zhu Yuanzhang.
    Tighnari can refer to the Mac dynasty of Vietnam or Lin Xian who was executed by Zhu Yuanzhang.
  </p>
  <p>
    Baizhu's abilities refer to various people executed by Zhu,
    including Hu Weiyong, Lan Yu, Qi Tai, etc.
  </p>

  <h2>Banners</h2>
  <p>First half is Nahida with Nilou.
    Second half is Ganyu with Baizhu.
    Looks like this patch will feature all female characters as 5 stars.
    The second half banner pairing is odd, given that Zhu executed Lan Yu and Lin Xian.
    But yet again, Zhu executed so many people that Baizhu would not really work with any character in Genshin.
    Contrary to the shilling of the USA FBI and media propaganda, the weapon banner for the second half will suck.
    The Xiao Alhaitham weapon banner was much better.
    The USA media lies so much that the world needs to use Zhu Yuanzhang and Zhu Di to punish them as well.    
  </p><p>
    Ganyu is getting too many reruns. She already ran once in version 3.0 with Shanhu Yixin.
    That instance represented interference in corporate affairs.
    Now Ganyu is running again with Baizhu and Kaveh.
    This represents the second violation in corporate affairs.
    Genshin is now interfering in internal affairs as much as the USA hegemon.
    Ganyu needs to be reran less often,
    and there needs to be more opportunities for other characters like Eula to rerun.
  </p><p>
    Speaking of corporate interference, let's discuss Kaveh's (Kawei) voice actors,
    specifically the English, Chinese, and Japanese voice actors.
    All of them are examples of combining the names of multiple coworkers
    to give undue favoritism to a particular person.
    If this kind of politicization of Genshin characters is going to continue in the future,
    then there is a serious problem.
    This kind of interference in a particular USA company 
    dates back to September 2021, when Sangonomiya Kokomi (Shanhu Yixin) was released.
    This represented one of the early instances of interference in corporate affairs
    by combining multiple people's names to manipulate media and achieve certain political agendas.
  </p><p>
    Next, let's discuss Kaveh's smearing of Alhaitham in December 2022 and what happened on Layla's birthday in 2022.
    First, Kaveh's smearing is evidence that certain scriptwriters have access to Wechat chat histories,
    particular to the real life person connected to Sango
    (which must have been granted by Tencent or some other institutional authority for whatever reason).
    Second, it shows that certain writers are willing to believe whatever this person writes at face-value,
    even if what they write is full of lies.
    Third, it shows that they are willing to twist lies to create even more lies to make political attacks on fictional characters.
    It is recommended that these writers' access to confidential and personal Wechat information be revoked
    as clearly this information is being abused and weaponized for political purposes.
  </p><p>
    On the contents of Kaveh's smear,
    it appears that the people who wrote it do not care about people around them.
    Moreover, the scriptwriters are the ones who are defiant to their leadership 
    by creating all these story quests (Nilou, Nahida, Alhaitham, Kazuha 2.8 event, 3.2 event) that oppose authority,
    as well as making decisions and designing events and banners against the desires of their superiors.
    Ironically, it appears that the scriptwriters are the ones that need to be excluded from major meetings
    and excluded from key decision making.
    Leave that for the real adults to decide.
    That stuff is way above their paygrade.
    The scriptwriters can only fabricate a fictional story of who gets put in jail and who gets punished.
    By contrast, their superiors with real authority and power dictate which real actual people get put in jail and get punished.
    There appears to be a disconnect between the fiction created by the media
    and the interests of those with authority in power.
    This is troublesome since even for a small dynasty like the Ming dynasty,
    they could write stories like Journey to the West or Water Margin
    that conformed to the interests of the Ming elite.
    Perhaps it is because Zhu executed too many people in the Ming.
    It is suggested that greater surveillance and regulation is exercised over the media
    to avoid having the media oppose authority.
    There cannot be free speech if that free speech is manipulated by USA color revolutions in an attempt to overthrow you.
    Everything must be regulated, and it seems the scriptwriters have been given too much freedom this past year.
  </p><p>
    Moreover, Alhaitham and Layla have no connection to each other.
    Alhaitham did nothing to deserve what happened on Layla's birthday.
    That offense is a serious breach in trust that requires a public apology.
    It appears that things have gone down the dark road, where bad things happen on character's birthdays.
    If the USA media or Genshin truly cares about the rights of women,
    then recognize that Lai Xiaomin committed bigamy and had hundreds of mistresses.
    Lai is the one who disrespected and violated women's rights.
    Lai got the death penalty he fully deserved.
    It is hypocritical to say that only if your surname is not Lai, you are a criminal,
    but if your surname is Lai, you are not.
  </p><p>
    And that is only one execution.
    The way Li Hao murdered several sex slaves is worse than what happened to Lai.
    Zhu Yuanzhang and Zhu Di executed hundreds of thousands of Chinese.
    What Zhu did is hundreds of thousands of times worse than what happened to Lai.
    If anything, Baizhu needs to be the one bearing the responsibility to be punished.
    If Tighnari can be put on standard banner, then Baizhu deserves that a lot more.
    If people have the guts to pull a Yongle on Layla's birthday,
    then give the same punishment to Baizhu.
    Having a particular surname is a poor reason to evade punishment.
    Under heaven, all mortals cannot escape retribution.
