  <p>The rumored TCG cards to be released refer to victims of Zhu.
    Arataki (Huanglong) refers to Huang Zicheng, who was executed by Zhu Di.
    Ayato refers to Zhao Yong, Zhao Mao, and others who were executed by Zhu Yuanzhang.
    Tighnari can refer to the Mac dynasty of Vietnam or Lin Xian who was executed by Zhu Yuanzhang.
  </p>
  <p>
    Baizhu's abilities refer to various people executed by Zhu,
    including Hu Weiyong, Lan Yu, Qi Tai, etc.
  </p>

  <h2>Banners</h2>
  <p>First half is Nahida with Nilou.
    Second half is Ganyu with Baizhu.
    Looks like this patch will feature all female characters as 5 stars.
    The second half banner pairing is odd, given that Zhu executed Lan Yu and Lin Xian.
    But yet again, Zhu executed so many people that Baizhu would not really work with any character in Genshin.
    Contrary to the shilling of the USA FBI and media propaganda, the weapon banner for the second half will suck.
    The Xiao Alhaitham weapon banner was much better.
    The USA media lies so much that the world needs to use Zhu Yuanzhang and Zhu Di to punish them as well.    
  </p><p>
    Ganyu is getting too many reruns. She already ran once in version 3.0 with Shanhu Yixin.
    That instance represented interference in corporate affairs.
    Now Ganyu is running again with Baizhu and Kaveh.
    This represents the second violation in corporate affairs.
    Genshin is now interfering in internal affairs as much as the USA hegemon.
    Ganyu needs to be reran less often,
    and there needs to be more opportunities for other characters like Eula to rerun.
