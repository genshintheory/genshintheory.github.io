  <p>Gepard Landau, younger brother of Serval.</p>
  <p>The Jie (Ket) people inhabited north Asia and Siberia
    and once established several empires in north China between the Han and Tang dynasties.
    There are various theories on what kind of languages they spoke, ranging from Altaic (Turkic, Mongolic) to Yeniseian.
    They probably were more Yeniseian in stock.
    Over time, the Jie would either assimilate into Han Chinese culture (becoming part of the Tang)
    or merge into the various nomadic empires of the steppe such as the Gokturk confederation (which itself would be annexed by the Tang).
    Genetically, the Jie share similar haplogroups to north Han Chinese males.
