  <p>Gepard Landau, younger brother of Serval.</p>
  <p>The Jie (Ket) people inhabited north Asia and Siberia
    and once established several empires in north China between the Han and Tang dynasties.
    There are various theories on what kind of languages they spoke, ranging from Altaic (Turkic, Mongolic) to Yeniseian.
    They probably were more Yeniseian in stock.
    Over time, the Jie would either assimilate into Han Chinese culture (becoming part of the Tang)
    or merge into the various nomadic empires of the steppe such as the Gokturk confederation (which itself would be annexed by the Tang).
  </p><p>
    Genetically, the Jie share similar haplogroups with north Han Chinese, Russian, and north European males.
    The reason why Chinese and Europeans may look different (dark versus blonde hair, etc.), 
    despite having similar Y dna (descended from hg K), is because the mothers contribute the other half of the genes.
    The Chinese women probably look different from European women.
