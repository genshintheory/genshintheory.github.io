  <p>Gepard Landau is the younger brother of Serval.</p>

  <h2>Jie people</h2>
  <p>The Jie (ç¾¯) or Ket people inhabited north Asia and Siberia
    and once established several empires in north China between the Han and Tang dynasties.
    There are various theories on what kind of languages they spoke, ranging from Altaic (Turkic, Mongolic) to Yeniseian.
    They probably were more Yeniseian in stock.
    Over time, the Jie would either assimilate into Han Chinese culture (becoming part of the Tang)
    or merge into the various nomadic empires of the steppe such as the Gokturk confederation (which itself would be annexed by the Tang).
  </p><p>
    Genetically, the Jie share similar haplogroups with north Han Chinese, Russian, and north European males.
    The reason why Chinese and Europeans may look different (dark versus blonde hair, etc.), 
    despite having similar Y dna (descended from hg K), is because the mothers contribute the other half of the genes.
    The Chinese women probably look different from European women.
  </p><p>
    Anyways, in Genshin, we have discussed how anemo represents a kind of nomadic force in history, the Mongols being an example.
    This anemo element is to be distinguished from the cryo element, which appears to be associated with the far north.
    Perhaps the main difference is that anemo is more nomadic, whereas cryo is not necessarily nomadic.
    There are many ethnic groups living in north Asia (Siberia), but they are not necessarily nomadic.
    The Jie / Ket people are one example. Another example is the Chukchi people, who were conquered by Russia.
    Such people may not be nomadic but rather live in the forest or build igloos, while sustaining on fishing or hunting,
    rather than taming eagles like an Altaic horseback nomad would do.
    Conversely, nomadic groups do not always need to reside in very cold places.
    The Xiongnu, Gokturk, Mongol empires spanned regions that included deserts and latitudes further south than the Arctic chill could reach.
    These nomadic groups may have had to deal as much with sand, rivers, and seas as they had to deal with snow and ice.
    So this is one way of thinking about anemo and cryo as separate entities, even though they definitely have interconnections.

  <h2>Shield</h2>
  <p>Gepard's main use is his burst which gives all allies a decently strong shield.
    Gepard is also a very tanky character with high hp and def.
    The only downside is that his shield costs energy, whereas March 7th gives a shield using a skill. 
    Moreover, the Trailblazer can give all allies a shield with even a basic attack (even though this shield is nowhere near as tanky as March/Gepard's).
  </p><p>
    In Genshin, there are characters that give a shield with their Q.
    But this can be inconvenient if their Q costs 80 energy, as is the case for baizhu.
    Characters who give a shield via E are usually more convenient, such as Diona, Morax, Thoma, etc.
  </p><p>
    So the preservation trailblazer exists, and they are actually quite decent, giving a shield to everyone even with a basic attack.
    But the next revolution in the preservation dao would be a character that can use their skill 
    to give a shield to all allies that lasts long and is tankier than the trailblazer's.
    The shield does not need to be as tanky as Gepard's (and maybe not even March's) or else that could put them out of business, 
    disrupting the balance of the game (unless of course HSR deliberately wants to overthrow Gepard).
    However the shield should at least be tankier than the trailblazer's (a free unit).
