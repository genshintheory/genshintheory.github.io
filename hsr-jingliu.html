  <p>Jingliu, ice destruction, afflicted by mara
  </p>
  <p>She can actually work well with Blade as her team hp drain will give Blade more charge stacks.
    Of course she benefits from healers such as Luocha.
    In her special moon state, she is SP neutral.
    But she will need to gain stacks to enter that state.
  </p><p>
    In her moon state, she gets a bunch of crit rate.
    Also her skill gets enhanced to blasts
    and will consume hp from all members of the team to buff her atk.
  </p><p>
    Bronya, Tingyun, the usual suspects are good for her.
  </p>

  <p>Her E1 and E6 give her a bunch of crit value.
    Her E4 allows her to buff her atk even more.
    So Jingliu is a character that can get high atk and high crit.
    The only thing she wants more of is damage bonus.
    Her E2 gives her E 80% dmg bonus after using Q.
