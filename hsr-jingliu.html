  <p>Jingliu, ice destruction, afflicted by mara
  </p>
  <p>She can actually work well with Blade as her team hp drain will give Blade more charge stacks.
    Of course she benefits from healers such as Luocha.
    In her special moon state, she is SP neutral.
    But she will need to gain syzygy stacks to enter that state.
  </p><p>
    In her moon state (Spectral Transmigration), she gets a bunch of crit rate.
    Also her skill gets enhanced to blasts
    and will consume hp from all members of the team to buff her atk.
  </p><p>
    Bronya, Tingyun, the usual suspects are good for her.
  </p>

  <p>Her E1 and E6 give her a bunch of crit value.
    Her E4 allows her to buff her atk even more.
    So Jingliu is a character that can get high atk and high crit.
    So in this sense she is sort of like Itto.
  </p><p>
    The only thing she wants more of is damage bonus.
    Her E2 gives her E 80% dmg bonus after using Q.
  </p>

  <p>The goal is to stay in her enhanced state for as long as possible.
    This will usually involve using her Q during her moon state to gain stacks and prolong the state.
    In her enhanced state, using her buffed skill will consume 1 stack.
    When she reaches 0 stacks her enhanced state ends.
  </p><p>
    Outside this buffed state, her E gives her 1 syzygy stack.
    Her Q also gives 1 stack.
    When she has 2 syzygy stacks she enters the enhanced state.
  </p><p>
    Her technique can freeze enemies and give her 1 stack when entering battle.
  </p><p>
    Before E6 she can get a max of 3 stacks.
    Her E6 increases the cap to 4 stacks and gives her 1 extra stack when she enters the enhanced moon state.
  </p>

  <p>Because she gets so much crit rate in her enhanced state,
    one can usually go for a crit dmg headpiece.
  </p>


  <h2>Jingliu in Genshin</h2>
  <p>In Genshin, Jingliu is a cryo sword user.
    Using E gives 1 syzygy stack.
    Using Q gives 1 stack.
    Think of stacks like Alhaitham's mirrors.
    When she has at least 1 stack, she gains cryo infusion on sword.
    Each stack lasts say 4s (like Alhaitham's mirror).
    So if she has 2 stacks, her cryo infusion lasts 8s.
  </p><p>
    When she has 2 stacks, she enters a buffed state.
    Her NA and CA will gain 50% crit rate and greatly increased aoe,
    and using her CA will drain the team hp to buff her atk.
