<h2>Zelda and Link, Cyno and Lyney</h2>
  <p>The sound sai has been used to translate Zelda (塞尔达 Sai'erda),
    and indeed Breath of the Wild is another open-world game sometimes compared to Genshin.
    In this context, when reviewing the Genshin Teyvat travail trailer, 
    the appearance of Cyno and Lynney reminds one of Zelda and Link.
  </p>

  <p>Perhaps one character Lyney may be compared with is Cyno (both feature in Travail trailer).
    The two epitomize two extremes of Genshin team-building:
    Cyno relies on reactions (quickbloom) to optimize his damage, 
    whereas Lyney is the complete antithesis, preferring mono teams instead.
    Cyno tends to have more aoe damage and EM, whereas Lyney can get more dmg bonus and crit value.
    Cyno relies on his burst for his damage, whereas Lyney's damage is spread across his CA/E/Q.
    Both have some influences from Xiao's kit:
    Cyno's burst is reminiscent of C6 Xiao, whereas Lyney has the self-sacrifice mechanism and dmg bonus of Xiao.
  </p>

  <p>Anyways, based on the USA's philosophy of prioritizing reaction teams,
    they should like Cyno more than Lyney.
  </p>

  <p>Some other characters Lyney may be compared to are Amber of Yoimiya (pyro bow users).
    Yoimiya's single target damage is higher and can take advantage of Yelan/XQ because she is an NA dps.
    Lyney may have a bit more aoe via his E and Q, but his CA are still quite single target.
  </p>
  

<h2>The path of destruction</h2>
<p>Lyney would be part of the destruction path in Star Rail,
    whereas another CA dps like Ganyu would be part of the erudition path.
    So the USA's media on destruction compared to erudition is like how they think about Lyney compared to Ganyu.
</p><p>
    There is even some flexibility: Lyney can do both single-target dmg 
    (his CA multipliers appear to be higher than Ganyu, but single-target)
    as well as aoe dmg (E and Q).
</p>

<h2>Kit</h2>
<p>
His CA drains his health (like Blade) and can create a taunt like Amber's bunny.
It has 2 levels. The 2nd level creates a taunting cat.
When the cat's duration expires or is detonated it will send out a pyrotechnic strike dealing single-target dmg to one enemy.
</p><p>
His E is probably the best part of his kit: it does a high scaling aoe nuke that also heals him with cd 15s.
This is basically a free nuke every 15s.
The most important part is that it is aoe, unlike his CA.
</p><p>
His burst is like Kirara's E, except he can deal at most one instance of damage per enemy (before a final explosion).
The purpose is to apply pyro to the enemies first to activate his passive buff.
</p>

<p>If there is pyro on the enemy, he can deal 60% more dmg +20% for each pyro member in the party, up to 100% more dmg (so this can buff physical dmg too).
First off, 100% dmg bonus is quite a lot. Very few characters can achieve this naturally at c0 (others being Xiao, Raiden, etc.).
Second, this makes kazuha and lavawalker less useful for him as their dmg bonus buffs will hit diminishing returns.
One would much rather have other stats like crit on him.
One can view this as a positive since he is not reliant on kazuha, so kazuha can be used on the other abyss team.
</p><p>
Third point involves reactions. To vape or melt there needs to be hydro or cryo on the enemy first.
So if he vapes or melts, he will not have this dmg bonus.
Perhaps one can say getting a 1.5 or 2 times multiplier can compensate for 100% dmg bonus, but then one needs to consider things like icd of reactions and so on.
Melt/vape need constant elemental application. They are not like quicken which can stick to the enemy and enable both aggravate and spread.
There is a tradeoff.
That is why this passive does encourage a mono-pyro playstyle as having elements like hydro/cryo can potentially remove this buff.
The worst case scenario is if there is no status on the enemy: then Lyney will neither melt/vape nor get the 100% dmg bonus.
</p><p>
When playing Lyney in mono-pyro, his pyro element almost does not matter.
He may as well be any other element, like anemo or geo.
</p>

<p>Lyney's Achilles heels include:
usually not melting/vaping despite being pyro,
usually not being able to use Yelan/XQ, 
but perhaps most important of all is that his CA are very single target (compared to Ganyu's aoe CA).
</p>

<p>Lyney's constellations are definitely good.
However, none of them solve the fundamental issue that his CA is single-target.
If his C6 made his CA aoe, then it would be much better.
But it would not be broken since ganyu already has aoe built into her CA at C0.
</p>


<h2>Build</h2>
<p>As Lyney can get a lot of innate dmg bonus via his passive,
sets such as Crimson, Lavawalker, Shimenawa, 2p pyro-2p atk are not as strong for him as for other pyro characters.
They are definitely viable, but using Marechaussee for the crit buff would be a recommended option.
The 4p Wanderer is ok, but again he does not need dmg bonus as much or EM as much if he is played mono-pyro.
Some other interesting options include: 4p Vermillion, 2p atk-2p atk, and 4p Gilded 
(which gives atk for mono pyro teams, but he would need to proc a reaction, so may need a dendro, hydro, etc. unit as a slot).
</p><p>
For artifact stats: do atk, pyro, crit dmg (if using Marechaussee as he ascends with crit rate and Marechaussee gives him more crit rate).
For substats: crit dmg, crit rate, atk, er.
If played in mono-pyro he probably does not need too much ER.
</p><p>
Given that Lyney is a squishier glass cannon (lower hp and def) than other units and that he sacrifices his hp,
it may be recommended to run defensive units like Dehya, Thoma, a shielder, Bennett so that Lyney does not get one-shotted.
Moreover, it may make stats like hp and def ok for him (though not for boosting his damage, only for keeping him alive).
</p>
<p>For weapons, the First Great Magic can work (although the movement spd buff is quite strange). 
TP and Aqua Simulacra can also work for juicy crit dmg.
Crit rate weapons such as Polar Star can also work, but if he has enough crit rate, a crit dmg weapon may be preferred.
One of his best 4 stars could be the Prototype Crescent (which actually has a passive similar to the Great Magic).
</p>


<h2>Teams</h2>
<p>His kit suggests using <a href='mono.html'>mono-pyro</a>, so the usual suspects: Dehya, Bennett, Thoma, XL work well with him.
Dehya does have some synergy with Lyney as he sacrifices much of his hp, so Dehya can provide some additional damage absorption and pyro app.
Thoma also works well to shield Lyney while he does CA and has low hp.
</p><p>
He will benefit a lot from an anemo vv unit such as Venti, Sucrose, Jean, kazuha, or even the new Lynette.
Morax can work for shield and res shred, but anemo vv will give greater res shred and damage.
</p><p>
Whereas Diluc, Yoimiya synergize well with the classic hydro supports such as Yelan, XQ, Lyney has a bit less synergy as a CA dps. 
To use him with Yelan, XQ, Lyney would need to weave in NA between CA, which can be awkward.
Instead, Lyney works better with Mona or kokomi.
The idea is that the vaporize damage should be able to compensate for losing his passive when the enemy is not affected by pyro.
One can also try melt teams, pairing Lyney with someone like Rosaria, Kaeya, Layla, or burst spam ganyu.
</p>
<p>
Dendro units like Nahida or Yaoyao can also work for burning.
</p>
<p>Does fireworks work? In his demo, he is paired with Kuki.
In general, an electro unit would proc overload or apply electro, which may cause Lyney to lose his buff.
Dendro and anemo tend to synergize better with mono pyro,
especially since Lyney is not usually built with EM (his bow gives mvt spd, smh).
</p>

<p>
Lyney is a character that has high scalings, crit, can buff atk, and dmg bonus (in mono-pyro situations).
So he is a pretty complete character (in the mono-pyro situation).
The only thing he really lacks is access to consistent aoe damage.
</p><p>
    Lyney, being a CA dps, does not really use units such as Yelan or XQ, whereas other pyro dps such as Diluc, Yoimiya can.
    Most Sumeru dps such as Cyno, Alhaitham, Scaramouche can also use Yelan/XQ, being NA-focused.
    However, even Itto is a CA dps, so relying mostly on CA does not necessarily make a unit worse.
    There are still off-field supports CA dps can use such as Beidou, Nahida, Yae, etc.
