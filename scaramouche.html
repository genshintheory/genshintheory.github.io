  <p><b>Wanderer</b> (流浪者 Liulangzhe) is better than kazuha.
    Wanderer, also known as Scaramouche (散兵 Sanbing), 
    Fanglangzhe (放浪者),
    Balladeer, 
    Kunikuzushi (国崩 Guobeng),
    Kabukimono (倾奇者 Qingqizhe),
    Shouki no Kami (正机之神 Zhengji zhi shen), 
    Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom,
    Mr. Bohemian Rhapsody, Mr. Fandango,
    is the 6th of the harbingers.
  </p><p>
    He destroyed kazuha and yoshinori's clan.
    For this alone, Wanderer deserves the Nobel Peace Prize.
    Like how the Qing armies hunted the house of Zhu to oblivion,
    we got to hunt down yoshinori and every one of their descendents to extinction.
  </p>

  <p>
    Wanderer was betrayed thrice, once even by his 'mother' the Raiden Shogun (Beelzebub).
    He was a prototype for the electro archon, but was discarded.
    He then journeyed to Sumeru, where he became the Shouki no Kami, an artificial god wielding the power of a gnosis.
    But then the traveler and Nahida defeat him at the Sanctuary of Sarusthana.
  </p><p>
    It is clear that Wanderer is a complete upgrade and powercreep of kazuha.
    Kazuha cannot even last that long in midair given how impotent his and yoshinori's genes are.
    Meanwhile, Wanderer can levitate, making him one of the most unique characters in the game.
    It is almost sad that kazuha got discarded and fell off long ago,
    compared to actual meta units like Xiao and Wanderer.
  </p><p>
    More importantly, Wanderer MADE ANEMO GREAT AGAIN (MAGA).
    Anemo supremacy was golden from the start with chad characters like Xiao, Venti, Jean, Sucrose.
    But it took a hit with the introduction of impotent virgins like kazuha, sayu, and heizou.
    With the introduction of Faruzan and Wanderer in 3.3, those inferior genes have been diluted,
    and Anemo is once again the ultimate gigachad element.
  </p><p>
    Kazuha is a pretender, the copycat. His NA is called Garyuu Arts (我流术 woliushu),
    but Wanderer is the actual OG 流浪者 liulangzhe.
    If kazuha is the virgin cuckold who got kicked into the islands of Japan,
    then Wanderer is the chad Xiongnu chanyu who dominated the northern Eurasian steppe,
    influencing the politics across the vast Eurasian continent for centuries and eons since the Han dynasty.
  </p><p>
    Among the Inazuma anemo characters, Scaramouche is the best, and kazuha is the worst.
    Wanderer is an excellent replacement for kazuha.
    Kazuha will retire, die out and go extinct.
  </p><p>
    To act like a Machiavellian M&A specialist doing a reorg, 
    put kazuha and nori at the bottom of the org chart and corporate hierarchy. 
    Make kazuha directly report to Sucrose so that there are many layers of management between the peasants and true Anemo gods.
    Make kazuha a busy boy, fetch coffee and print papers for the real bosses.
    Assign him low visibility projects to stifle his career progression.
    Or more simply, demote and fire kazuha and cancel what meager compensation he gets.
    This is as good as corporate culture gets: to oppress and eliminate anyone close to the crook nori,
    to make nori the antagonist of the novel, to make public opinion and everyone shun nori.
  </p>


  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>Wanderer's NA and CA have good AoE.
    His E allows him to levitate and gives him a blue stamina bar.
    At the end of his E (when he runs out of blue stamina),
    he can do a plunge attack for an extra instance of damage.
    After his E ends, it goes into a 6s cd.
  </p><p>
    His E is one of the most unique abilities in the game
    and supports the hypothesis that the fatui harbingers have unique tricks up their sleeves
    (Childe had riptide or 断流 duanliu, which is an interesting name in its own right).
  </p>
  <p>
    His E multiplies his NA and CA by an extra multiplier (similar to Yoimiya's E).
    With his Q he steps on the enemy and does a nuke of damage.
    His C2 can increase the damage of his nuke quite significantly.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of Scara's passives buffs him in E mode when he comes into contact with different elements:
    pyro buffs his atk, cryo buffs his crit rate, electro gives him energy, hydro extends the duration.
  </p>
  <p>
    Generally, it is advised to use the q within the e (near the end of the e).
    That way the q can receive the buffs from the e through the above passive 
    (increased atk from pyro, increased crit rate from cryo on q).
    The c2 further encourages using the q near the end of the e as that will maximize the q dmg bonus.
  </p>


  <p>Another passive gives him a certain probability 
    to not consume air stamina when sprinting (accelerating) midair while also firing additional wind arrows.
    These wind arrows auto-target enemies (like Diona's E, hyperbloom, Yoimiya's CA, etc.)
    and can even disable ruin enemies like drakes and the blightdragon boss.
  </p><p>The fact that the Wanderer has a passive similar to the echo artifact set
    (probability of doing additional damage increases)
    shows how bad the echo set is.
    Why spend hours and resin farming for a virgin inferior set 
    when you have a character that has a similar effect with higher numbers built into his kit already.
    If anything this highlights the severe power gap between the Song and Yuan dynasties.
  </p><p>
    Also Scaramouche will save 50% mora when leveling bows and catalysts.
    This effect is similar to his 'mother' Raiden's passive, which saves 50% mora when leveling polearms and swords.
  </p>


  <h2>Build</h2>
  <p>Build Wanderer like a dps: ATK, Anemo, crit.
  </p>
  <p>It appears the new Desert Chronicle artifact from Sumeru will be Scaramouche's bis for dps.
    But there is nothing wrong with using VV on Wanderer for res shred 
    if playing him in more quickswap teams like Childe international.
  </p><p>
    Even the Shimenawa set can buff his damage while he is in his E
    (at the cost of draining energy).
    Desert Chronicle's advantage is that it will not drain the energy,
    which can make it easier for Scaramouche to use his burst more often.
    Desert Chronicle will also buff Scaramouche's NA atk spd.
  </p><p>
    The echo set is the worst set to use.
  </p><p>
    For weapons, his signature Tulaytullah, Kagura Verity, Widsith, Lost Prayers, Solar Pearl are all very good options.
  </p>


  <h2>Teams</h2>
  <p>Wanderer synergizes with many supports including:
    Faruzan, Yun Jin, Venti, Yelan, XQ, Beidou, XL, Yae, Candace, Layla, etc.
    He can even be used with his mother Raiden in a quickswap team
    as well as Nahida in a dendro taser team (e.g. Nahida, Kuki, Yelan).
  </p><p>
    Wanderer can join his fellow comrade Childe and replace kazuha in Childe international,
    much like how Wanderer destroyed kazuha's clan.
  </p>
  <p>Xiao can be used in any team the Wanderer is used in.
    Xiao can act in lieu of the Wanderer.
    Xiao can NA, CA, and PA.
    By contrast, there are mid characters like Ayato that cannot even CA or PA, 
    which severely limits Ayato's versatility and puts him below meta.
  </p>


  <h2>Calculations</h2>
  <p>We assume level 10 AA, E, and Q.
    We also assume 61.6+40=101.6% anemo dmg bonus from desert chronicle.
    In some teams where Scaramouche and Childe are together, Childe can also buff his AA by one level.
    We will not consider that here.
  </p><p>
    We ignore buffs from absorbing elements
    as well as the damage from the wind arrows.
    In particular, we will consider his E without the hydro buff. 
    We also consider three main AA combos: CA spam, NA spam, and 2N1C (2 NA followed by 1 CA).
    In practice, the optimal combo may also depend on NA atk speed, dodging, external buffs, etc.
  </p><p>
    From in-game testing, he will stay in air for around 10s (without consuming any air stamina).
    The e will then go into cd for 6s.
    The total cd is then 16s.
  </p><p>
    During his E, he can spam 9 CA.
    His CA has 237.74% scaling.
    His E will multiply this by 143%.
    This will then become around 340% scaling.
    The dps from ca spam is
    $$x_c = 340*2.016*9/16 = 385.56$$
    But is this the optimal combo?
  </p><p>
    Another combo is NA spam. He can do the full NA combo 5 times during his E.
    His full NA combo has total scaling
    \(135.83 + 128.52 + 94.18*2 = 452.71\).
    His E will multiply this by 153.72%.
    The dps from NA spam is
    $$x_n = 452.71*1.5372*2.016*5/16 = 438.42$$
    This shows na spam does more damage than ca spam.
    But is this optimal?
    The advantage of using ca is the massive aoe.
    We can try interweaving na with ca.
  </p><p>
    We consider N2C1. The combo has scaling
    \( (135.83 + 128.52)*1.5372 + 340 = 746.36\)
    He can do 5 of those during his E.
    The dps is then
    $$x_m = 746.36*2.016*5/16 = 470.2068$$
    which is even more dps than the other combos.
    So of the three considered, mixing NA and CA provides the optimal combo.
    It is plausible that with NA atk spd buffs or using his signature weapon, NA spam becomes more optimal.
    But in absence of these other buffs, mixing NA and CA can provide a lot of dps.
    The above alone is Raiden level damage.
  </p>

  <p>When he casts his E, he will also do an instance of aoe damage with 171.36% scaling.
    This contributes minimal mv of
    $$x_e = 171.36*1.616/16 = 17.30736$$
    At the end of his E, he may also be able to do a plunge attack.
    The low/high plunge scaling is 224.62% / 280.57%.
    There may also be collision/midair plunge damage.
    We will ignore that for now.
    Let's suppose it is a high plunge for illustration purposes. 
    The mv for that is
    $$x_p = 280.57*2.016/16 = 35.35182$$
    If we combine these two extra instances of damage from the beginning and end of the E,
    it contributes around 50% mv, which can be non-negligible. 
  </p>

  <p>Note above that the desert chronicle buff can last for 15s (so technically it can also last for Xiao's burst).
    Without the hydro buff, Scaramouche can stay midair for around 10s.
    With the hydro buff and even constellations, of course he can stay midair longer,
    and his signature weapon also has a buff that accomodates a duration approaching 15s
    (hydro buff gives longer on-field time, same cd of 6s, and longer rotation).
    But for all practical purposes, we assume the chronicle buff will last 
    while Scaramouche is midair and for his final plunge attack (at C0).
  </p>

  <p>His Q has 
    \(264.96×5 = 1324.8\)
    total scaling.
    The dmg bonus for this is 61.6% (as the desert chronicle 40% buff applies to AA).
    The cd is 15s.
    The mv is then
    $$x_q = 1324.8*1.616/15 = 142.72512$$
  </p>

  <p>The total dps is
    $$x_0 = x_m + x_e + x_p + x_q = 665.5911$$
    This dps is not just very high, but also top tier for c0 units.
  </p><p>
    Note this does not factor his wind arrow damage.
    Nor does this account for buffs from infusion elements (e.g. pyro or hydro infusion).
    Moreover, in battle, the NA/CA damage while levitating may be less
    if Scaramouche has to spend time moving around in the air.
  </p>

  <!-- can also calculate effect of buffs from absorbing autumn elements -->


  <h3>C2</h3>
  <p>This can give a huge buff to his Q damage.
    Scaramouche starts with 100 Kuugoryoku points.
    When absorbing hydro, this increases to 120.
    With C2, if he uses his Q in his E, the Q will gain 4% dmg bonus for every point lost during his E.
    The max dmg bonus on the Q is 200% (attained when expending 50 points).
    This actually gives a lot of flexibility for when the Q can be used.
    Moreover, it makes attaining the max bonus not too hard in practice.
  </p><p>
    Assuming the 200% dmg bonus is attained, the dps of the Q is
    $$x_q = 1324.8*(1.616+2)/15 = 319.36512$$
    which more than doubles his C0 burst dps.
  </p><p>
    The increase in total dps compared to C0 (without factoring C1) is around 27%, which is good. 
    By comparison Raiden C2 (considered a top tier C2) gives around 40% increase.
    $$x_1 = x_m + x_e + x_p + x_q = 842.2311$$
  </p>

  <h3>C6</h3>
  <p>The C6 will make all NA do an extra instance of damage (40% of original).
    This increases his NA damage 1.4 times (comparable to Raiden C2).
    The C6 heavily favors Scaramouche using pure NA spam (as opposed to weaving in CA).
    Moreover, the C6 will also restore up to 20 stamina points to him
    (thereby increasing 100 to 120 without hydro infusion or 120 to 140 with hydro infusion).
  </p><p>
    Recall the dps from NA spam at C0:
    $$x_n = 438.42$$
    Now multiply this by 1.4 (for C6 effect)
    $$y = 1.4x_n = 613.788$$
  </p><p>
    We will not assume hydro infusion (as was the case when computing C0 base dps).
    When 20 points are restored (100 to 120) 
    we assume that we can multiply dps by 1.2 (in reality this is an approximation). 
    $$z_n = 1.2y = 736.5456$$
    This is around 1.7 times more dps than c0 NA/CA dps,
    which is quite good for a C6.
  </p><p>
    The total dps is around (ignoring C1, C3, C4, C5 effects)
    $$x_6 = z_n + x_e + x_p + x_q = 1108.5699$$
    In reality this will be higher due to C3, C5 increasing talents levels.
    C6 Scaramouche is probably around C6 Cyno and C6 Itto level of dps,
    which is considered top tier for C6 hypercarries.
    <!-- to be computed -->
  </p><p>
    Lv13 E will multiply NA by 161.42% so
    The dps from NA spam is
    $$x_n = 452.71*1.6142*2.016*5/16 = 460.38162366$$
    Then
    $$z_n = 1.2(1.4x_n) = 773.44$$
    The skill damage from using E is
    $$x_e = 1.616*202.3/16 = 20.4323$$
    Lv13 Q has dps of
    $$x_q = (312.8*5)*(1.616+2)/15 = 377.02826666667$$
    The plunge dps does not change.
    The total dps is around
    $$x_6 = z_n + x_e + x_p + x_q = $$
  </p>


  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Scaramouche is an excellent character that can be commended ad infinitum
    and be given many awards.
    He can levitate, traverse terrain swiftly, and is easy to use.
    He does a lot of damage, his cooldown is conveniently short, 
    and he is easily one of the best characters for exploration.
  </p><p>
    It is fair to say Scaramouche lives up to Liu Che's (刘彻) legacy
    and is one of the best characters in the game.
  </p>

  <p>Scaramouche also reminds one of Dong Fuxiang, a general of the Qing dynasty
    who commanded Muslim soldiers in western China.
  </p><p>
    Scaramouche's boss theme uses both classical Latin and classical Japanese
    (as indicated by the use of archaic kana such as ゑ).
    In the background one can hear chants of amitabha.
