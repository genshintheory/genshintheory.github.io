<title>Scaramouche</title>

  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  <p>Wanderer (流浪者 Liulangzhe),
    also known as Scaramouche (散兵 Sanbing), Balladeer, 
    Kunikuzushi (国崩 Guobeng),
    Kabukimono (倾奇者 Qingqizhe),
    Shouki no Kami (正机之神 Zhengji zhi shen), 
    Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom,
    Mr. Bohemian Rhapsody, Mr. Fandango,
    is the 6th of the harbingers.
  </p>

  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>Wanderer's NA and CA have good AoE.
    His E allows him to levitate and gives him a blue stamina bar.
    At the end of his E (when he runs out of blue stamina),
    he can do a plunge attack for an extra instance of damage.
  </p><p>
    His E is one of the most unique abilities in the game
    and supports the hypothesis that the fatui harbingers have unique tricks up their sleeve
    (Childe had riptide or 断流 duanliu, which is an interesting name in its own right).
  </p>

  <p>
    One of Scara's passives buffs him in E mode when he swirls with different elements:
    buffing his atk, crit rate, energy, or stamina duration.
  </p>
  <p>Another passive gives him a certain probability 
    to not consume air stamina when sprinting midair while also firing additional wind arrows.
  </p><p>
    Also Scaramouche will save 50% mora when leveling bows and catalysts.
    This is effect is similar to his 'mother' Raiden's passive, which saves 50% mora when leveling polearms and swords.
  </p>

  <p>With his Q, he steps on the enemy.
  </p>


  <h2>Build</h2>
  <p>It appears the new Desert Chronicle artifact from Sumeru will be Scaramouche's bis for dps.
    But there is nothing wrong with using VV on Wanderer for res shred 
    if playing him in more quickswap teams like Childe international.
  </p><p>
    Even the Shimenawa set can buff his damage while he is in his E
    (at the cost of draining energy).
    Desert Chronicle's advantage is that it will not drain the energy,
    which can make it easier for Scaramouche to use his burst more often.
