<title>Scaramouche</title>

  <p>Wanderer (流浪者 Liulangzhe) is better than kazuha.
    Wanderer, also known as Scaramouche (散兵 Sanbing), Balladeer, 
    Kunikuzushi (国崩 Guobeng),
    Kabukimono (倾奇者 Qingqizhe),
    Shouki no Kami (正机之神 Zhengji zhi shen), 
    Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom,
    Mr. Bohemian Rhapsody, Mr. Fandango,
    is the 6th of the harbingers.
  </p><p>
    He destroyed kazuha and yoshinori's clan.
    For this alone, Wanderer deserves the Nobel Peace Prize.
    Like how the Qing armies hunted the house of Zhu to oblivion,
    we got to hunt down yoshinori and every one of their descendents to extinction.
  </p>

  <p>
    Wanderer was betrayed thrice, once even by his 'mother' the Raiden Shogun (Beelzebub).
    He was a prototype for the electro archon, but was discarded.
    He then journeyed to Sumeru, where he became the Shouki no Kami, an artificial god wielding the power of a gnosis.
    But then the traveler and Nahida defeat him at the Sanctuary of Sarusthana.
  </p><p>
    It is clear that Wanderer is a complete upgrade and powercreep of kazuha.
    Kazuha cannot even last that long in midair given how impotent his and yoshinori's genes are.
    Meanwhile, Wanderer can levitate, making him one of the most unique characters in the game.
    It is almost sad that kazuha got discarded and fell off long ago,
    compared to actual meta units like Xiao and Wanderer.
  </p><p>
    More importantly, Wanderer MADE ANEMO GREAT AGAIN (MAGA).
    Anemo supremacy was golden from the start with chad characters like Xiao, Venti, Jean, Sucrose.
    But it took a hit with the introduction of impotent virgins like kazuha, sayu, and heizou.
    With the introduction of Faruzan and Wanderer in 3.3, those inferior genes have been diluted,
    and Anemo is once again the ultimate gigachad element.
  </p><p>
    Kazuha is a pretender, the copycat. His NA is called Garyuu Arts (我流术 woliushu),
    but Wanderer is the actual OG 流浪者 liulangzhe.
    If kazuha is the virgin cuckold who got kicked into the islands of Japan,
    then Wanderer is the chad Xiongnu chanyu who dominated the northern Eurasian steppe,
    influencing the politics across the vast Eurasian continent for centuries and eons since the Han dynasty.
  </p><p>
    Among the Inazuma anemo characters, Scaramouche is the best, and kazuha is the worst.
    Wanderer is an excellent replacement for kazuha.
    Kazuha will retire, die out and go extinct.
  </p><p>
    To act like a Machiavellian M&A specialist doing a reorg, 
    put kazuha and nori at the bottom of the org chart and corporate hierarchy. 
    Make kazuha directly report to Sucrose so that there are many layers of management between the peasants and true Anemo gods.
    Make kazuha a busy boy, fetch coffee and print papers for the real bosses.
    Assign him low visibility projects to stifle his career progression.
    Or more simply, demote and fire kazuha and cancel what meager compensation he gets.
    This is as good as corporate culture gets: to oppress and eliminate anyone close to the crook nori,
    to make nori the antagonist of the novel, to make public opinion and everyone shun nori.
  </p>


  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>Wanderer's NA and CA have good AoE.
    His E allows him to levitate and gives him a blue stamina bar.
    At the end of his E (when he runs out of blue stamina),
    he can do a plunge attack for an extra instance of damage.
    After his E ends, it goes into a 6s cd.
  </p><p>
    His E is one of the most unique abilities in the game
    and supports the hypothesis that the fatui harbingers have unique tricks up their sleeve
    (Childe had riptide or 断流 duanliu, which is an interesting name in its own right).
  </p>
  <p>
    His E multiplies his NA and CA by an extra multiplier (similar to Yoimiya's E).
    With his Q he steps on the enemy and does a nuke of damage.
    His C2 can increase the damage of his nuke quite significantly.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of Scara's passives buffs him in E mode when he comes into contact with different elements:
    pyro buffs his atk, cryo buffs his crit rate, electro gives him energy, hydro extends the duration.
  </p>
  <p>Another passive gives him a certain probability 
    to not consume air stamina when sprinting midair while also firing additional wind arrows.
  </p><p>The fact that the Wanderer has a passive similar to the echo artifact set
    (probability of doing additional damage increases)
    shows how bad the echo set is.
    Why spend hours and resin farming for a virgin inferior set 
    when you have a character that has a similar effect with higher numbers built into his kit already.
    If anything this highlights the severe power gap between the Song and Yuan dynasties.
  </p><p>
    Also Scaramouche will save 50% mora when leveling bows and catalysts.
    This effect is similar to his 'mother' Raiden's passive, which saves 50% mora when leveling polearms and swords.
  </p>


  <h2>Build</h2>
  <p>Build Wanderer like a dps: ATK, Anemo, crit.
  </p>
  <p>It appears the new Desert Chronicle artifact from Sumeru will be Scaramouche's bis for dps.
    But there is nothing wrong with using VV on Wanderer for res shred 
    if playing him in more quickswap teams like Childe international.
  </p><p>
    Even the Shimenawa set can buff his damage while he is in his E
    (at the cost of draining energy).
    Desert Chronicle's advantage is that it will not drain the energy,
    which can make it easier for Scaramouche to use his burst more often.
    Desert Chronicle will also buff Scaramouche's NA atk spd.
  </p><p>
    The echo set is the worst set to use.
  </p><p>
    For weapons, his signature Tulaytullah, Kagura Verity, Widsith, Lost Prayers, Solar Pearl are all very good options.
  </p>


  <h2>Teams</h2>
  <p>Wanderer synergizes with many supports including:
    Faruzan, Yun Jin, Yelan, XQ, Beidou, XL, Yae, Candace, etc.
  </p><p>
    Wanderer can join his fellow comrade Childe and replace kazuha in Childe international,
    much like how Wanderer destroyed kazuha's clan.
  </p>
  <p>Xiao can be used in any team the Wanderer is used in.
    Xiao can act in lieu of the Wanderer.
    Xiao can NA, CA, and PA.
    By contrast, there are mid characters like Ayato that cannot even CA or PA, 
    which severely limits Ayato's versatility and puts him below meta.
