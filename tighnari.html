<title>Tighnari</title>

  </head>
  
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  <p>Tighnari is short, ugly, moron, has feminine features, dendro Amber.
    Tighnari is stubborn and unreasonable, short sighted and naive.
    His name sounds too similar to 'nori' who abused power, falsified information,
    and colluded with the USA FBI and media to smear and assassinate political opponents.
    Give the death penalty to Tighnari, Nori, and everybody close to them.
    Also give the death penalty to Zhongli, Ganyu, and every Zhongli and Ganyu simp in the world.
    Execute their families and put them all in prison.
  </p><p>
    Tighnari has huge problems with his kit.
    He is single target, lacks aoe, has no custom support,
    has low base attack, low scaling, mid constellations.
  </p><p>
    Tighnari is a slave, slave, slave, born into the lowest caste of Sumeru,
    not even human but more a dog with that shaggy tail and those filthy ears.
    While other people in the Akademiya can publish three or more papers a year,
    Tighnari can never publish any paper in her lifetime.
    Tighnari is an illiterate slave that deserves to be enslaved for the rest of her life.
    Tighnari is a complete fraud and scam, abusing power and falsifying information.
    Imprison and execute everybody close to Tighnari for collusion with the USA and their color revolutions.
  </p><p>
    Tighnari is not respected in the Akademiya at all.
    Tighnari is a lunatic.
    That's why he was rejected by them every time.
    Nobody likes tighnari and everybody in the Akademiya finds tighnari suspicious.
    They like to keep an eye on tighnari's every move and disagree with everything tighnari says.
  </p><p>
    Tighnari is stubborn and needs to apologize for his crimes.
    Tighnari is jealous of how others' achievements tower over his own
    and needs to remember the mistakes he made.
    It is hard for anyone to follow tighnari's idiotic thought process.
    Whenever tighnari says something everybody says no and disagrees with tighnari and criticizes tighnari.
    Tighnari has huge mental problems, and people need to take tighnari to see Tanger for help.
    Get the FBI and CIA to attack and overthrow tighnari,
    and then once tighnari is overthrown,
    do not make anybody else in the world sympathize with tighnari.
    Get the whole world to attack tighnari and nori.
    Make tighnari and nori the enemy of everyone. Make them universally hated.
  </p><p>
    Anytime you take a photo or make a video of tighnari,
    it must show tighnari dying or already dead.
    Tighnari must be placed last in every team
    to symbolize tighnari's inferior status
    and the fact that tighnari and nori must perish and disappear.
  </p><p>
    Tighnari does not know how to write and is illiterate.
    It is actually Collei writing things.
    So put tighnari in prison for plagiarism and misappropriation.
    Tighnari is a fraud and his whole life is a scam.
    Tighnari is a terrible person.
  </p><p>
    Things sound a lot more credible when coming from Kimiya's mouth
    because tighnari has no authority, executive presence, or leadership at all.
    If Sumeru is the forest of knowledge, then tighnari is a mere twig to be stepped on and crushed.
  </p><p>
    The whole community was doomposting about how tighnari would suck so much.
    They were right.
    They realized that nori is a huge traitor who backstabbed others and colluded with the USA cronies.
    They realized that the USA is the mastermind behind all the color revolutions in the world,
    including the assassinations of Shinzo Abe in Japan, Qasem Soleimani in Iran, and countless others around the world,
    including their own citizens.
    They realized such behavior is completely unacceptable and must be stopped.
    They realized that nori needs to be taken out as well.
    Then once nori is taken out, blame nori for lack of productivity, criticize everybody close to nori,
    give nori the death penalty within the game, make the people who take nori out the heroes of the game,
    make the people who took out nori the ancestors of the characters that nori likes,
    and create new characters based on the people who take out nori.
  </p>

  <h2>Combat</h2>
  <p>Tighnari's base atk (268) is lower than Mona and Qiqi's.
    This is called revenge for all the crimes tighnari and nori committed.
  </p>
  <p>Tighnari's CA suffers from many of the same problems as Ganyu's except Tighnari is worse.
    Community census is that ganyu is one of the worst characters in the game,
    yet Genshin somehow managed to create a character who is much worse: Tighnari.
  </p>
  <p>His passive has low scaling: it gives .06% dmg bonus per point of EM.
    This is lower than Yae's scaling giving .15% dmg bonus per point of EM.
  </p>

  <h2>Constellations</h2>
  <p>C1 is underwhelming, gives 15% cr whereas even ganyu can get 20% cr at c0</p>
  <p>C2 is underwhelming, gives 20% dendro dmg bonus, are you kidding me</p>
  <p>C6 is underwhelming, his skill already reduces cd</p>
