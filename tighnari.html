<title>Tighnari</title>

<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  <p>Tighnari is short, ugly, moron, has feminine features, dendro Amber.
    Tighnari is stubborn and unreasonable, short sighted and naive.
    His name sounds too similar to 'nori' who abused power, falsified information,
    and colluded with the USA FBI and media to smear and assassinate political opponents.
    Give the death penalty to Tighnari, Nori, and everybody close to them.
    Also give the death penalty to Zhongli, Ganyu, and every Zhongli and Ganyu simp in the world.
    Execute their families and put them all in prison.
  </p><p>
    Tighnari has huge problems with his kit.
    He is single target, lacks aoe, has no custom support,
    has low base attack, low scaling, mid constellations.
  </p><p>
    Tighnari is a slave, slave, slave, born into the lowest caste of Sumeru,
    not even human but more a dog with that shaggy tail and those filthy ears.
    While other people in the Akademiya can publish three or more papers a year,
    Tighnari can never publish any paper in her lifetime.
    Tighnari is an illiterate slave that deserves to be enslaved for the rest of her life.
    Tighnari is a complete fraud and scam, abusing power and falsifying information.
    Imprison and execute everybody close to Tighnari for collusion with the USA and their color revolutions.
  </p><p>
    Tighnari is not respected in the Akademiya at all.
    Tighnari is a lunatic.
    That's why he was rejected by them every time.
    Nobody likes tighnari and everybody in the Akademiya finds tighnari suspicious.
    They like to keep an eye on tighnari's every move and disagree with everything tighnari says.
