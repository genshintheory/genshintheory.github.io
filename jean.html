<p><b>Jean Gunnhildr</b> (Áê¥ Qin) of the Knights of Favnoius, is one of the best healers in the game.
</p>

<h2>Talents</h2>

<h3>Elemental Skill</h3>
<p>
	This can yeet enemies and be used to cause fall damage.
  Whether the skill lifts enemies depends on the weight of the target and Jean's level.
  As with other Anemo characters with similar vacuum effects, Jean should be leveled (no less than 20 levels below the enemy level) to lift targets.
</p>

<h3>Elemental Burst</h3>
<p>
  Heals a lot and has high scaling when cast.
  Also creates a field that does damage, heals over time, and applies anemo inside.
  This can be used to remove Azhdaha marks and other Ley Line effects.
  It can also be combined with Bennett's q (which applies Pyro) to shred Electro Lector shields with Pyro swirl 
  (as swirl will apply strong 2B gauges).
  Costs 80 energy.
</p>

<h3>Passives</h3>
<p>
  With her A1, normals have a chance to heal all party members, which is nice.
  Her A4 refunds 20% energy when using her q, effectively reducing the cost (by 16) to 64 energy.
</p>

<h2>Constellations</h2>
<p>Her c4 makes her q reduce Anemo RES by 40%, which is great for Xiao.</p>

<h2>Build</h2>
<p>Build her like a normal dps since her healing scales with total ATK.
  4p VV is usually her bis, but on some teams that don't need VV swirl (like Xiao teams),
  4p noblesse or 2p VV/2p glad are also fine.
</p><p>
  Weapons: Aquila Favonia, Skyward, Festering, Favonius.
  Swords with ER and high ATK are great for Jean.
</p>

<h2>Teams</h2>
<p>
Any team that needs VV shred and a healer
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Xiao-Jean-Albedo-Morax</li>
  <li>Eula-Raiden-Rosaria-Jean</li>

  <li>Raiden-Yae-Sara/Qing-Jean (mono-eletro)</li>
  <li>Pyro-Xingqiu-Jean (if using Bennett on another team)</li>
</ul>
