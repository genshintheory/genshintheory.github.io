<title>Paths</title>

  </head>
  
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  <p>The path system provides a kind of formula or template for designing characters.
    Just select the path / character role and use that to design the combat abilities.
    In Final Fantasy, the analog is the job system.
  </p><p>
    In Genshin, one can split the dps category in two: on-field dps and off-field dps.
  </p>

  <h2>DPS paths</h2>
  <p>Difference between erudition and destruction:
    Xiao, Itto, Cyno are similar characters.
    They are burst dps units that can deal impressive aoe damage against mobs of enemies.
    However, there are some key differences.
    Xiao and Itto are more destruction type characters, sacrificing some of their stats for increased damage,
    whereas Cyno is more of an erudition unit and does not have any such self-sacrificing mechanism.
    Xiao sacrifices his hp (buffs dmg bonus), Itto sacrifices res (buffs atk), but Cyno does not sacrifice anything (just buffs his EM and scalings).
    Xiao and Itto also have 70 energy cost, whereas Cyno has 80 energy cost (but this is a bit less relevant).
  </p>
  <p>The path of destruction is a kind of high-risk high-reward philosophy.
    It is about destruction not just of the enemy, but also of oneself.
    That is why survivability is part of the concept.
    When you create something so powerful that it will mutually hurt both you and your enemy,
    it is important that you are the last person left standing, so you can outlast your enemy.
    You make some sacrifice in exchange for much more power and damage.
    This is symbolized by the Aeon Nanook's path resonance in the simulated universe.
    This is also symbolized by the boss Svarog's move where he overloads one of his hands to self-destruct and hurt the player.
  </p><p>
    During WW2, the Japanese kamikaze pilots employed a similar type of strategy against the allies,
    where they flew suicidal planes to blow up and crash into an enemy, offing themselves in the process.
    Such a tactic does not always lead to victory. The important concept missed in the WW2 case is survivability.
    If you do not survive to begin with, you lose the game.
    So while destruction can be a powerful archetype and have its merits, having an excess amount of it might lead you off the path of survivability.
    It can be wreckless without moderation and lead to unforseen consequences without prudence.
  </p>

  
  <h2>Automatic dps</h2>
  <p>Subdps as automatic dps:
    deals damage without having to be active.
    follow up attacks, counters (himeko, svarog, march) all subdps category.
    in genshin, subdps also sometimes called off-field, but need not be off-field.
    example: can use yae on-field and do nothing but E still does damage.
    main characteristic of subdps is automatic damage / coordinated attack.
  </p><p>
    jing yuan is kind of like a subdps as lightning lord is follow-up / automatic (damage built up by using jing yuan abilities).
    by contrast seele is pure on-field carry.
    luocha heals are automatic (reactive / adaptive / 'smart' healing).
    things that are automatic or allow character to make more moves in a turn are generally considered positive.
  </p>


  <h2>Main path</h2>
  <p>Even though characters can belong to many paths, perhaps one of them is their main path.
    For example, c6 zhongli is a shielder that can heal, while baizhu is a healer that can shield.
    There is a difference. Here zhongli is fundamentally a preservation unit whose main role is to shield, with the healing being reactive and secondary.
    By contrast, baizhu is an abundance unit mainly designed to heal as his shield is complete garbage weak.
  </p>


  <h2>Final Fantasy and Star Rail</h2>

  <h3>Paladin</h3>
  <p>Tank, paladin overlap with preservation.
    Excalibur is often a weapon of paladin units.
    Excalibur features in the myth of Sir Arthur and involves pulling a sword out of a rock.
    This scene is emulated when the trailblazer pulls out the lance from a stone when meeting Qlipoth in Jarilo-VI,
    thereby embarking on the path of preservation.
  </p><p>
    Paladins center on the theme of chivalry (in final fantasy) and the knights of the round table.
    They specialize in defensive and supportive abilities.
    And this is seen by the various shielding, counter, and defensive abilities of the Belobog knights 
    Dunn, Gepard, and the Silvermane Guards.
  </p>

  <h3>Dragoon</h3>
  <p>In FF9, Freya is a dragoon character that can use the jump ability.
    This is like fly or dig in pokemon and allows her to avoid damage.
    After some time passes, she will nuke the enemy with her lance.
    During her trance state, she will remain airborne while attacking the enemy from up high.
    The jump ability is a signature move of dragoon characters in the FF series.
    The Highwind characters (except Alexander Highwind Tycoon) belong to this job class.
  </p><p>
    As of v1.1, there is currently no dragoon character in HSR (a character with a jump skill).
    Moreover, dragoon is not a class in HSR.
    However, dragoon does possess survivability (avoiding damage) and deals a lot of damage,
    so perhaps dragoon is a subclass of the destruction path.
  </p>
  <p>Is there an analog in Genshin? A character that can jump to avoid enemy attacks and also plunge to nuke the enemy?
    That is Xiao, the polearm-wielding yaksha.
    Xiao's burst is similar to Freya's trance state, where Xiao gets to jump and plunge repeatedly over time.
    Being able to jump to avoid enemy attacks is a form of survivability, characteristic of destruction characters.
    There are other anemo characters that can jump or levitate to avoid enemy attacks such as Scaramouche.
    But Xiao is the premiere dragoon dps of Genshin.
  </p>

  <p>So these are the characters that can fly. As for dig, there are several enemies in Genshin that can burrow underground to avoid attacks.
    These include the geovishap hatchlings, the wenut, the ruin serpent, certain ruin enemies, etc.
    The bathysmal vishap boss has a phase where they jump on a pillar and attack from above.
  </p><p>
    This also gives them some aerial immunity in combat.
    The blightdrake can also fly in air.
    The hypostasis cubes have periods of immunity.
    The jadeplume terrorshroom has a beserk mode.
    The ruin crab can shield itself. Some shadowy husks can also provide shields to themselves.
  </p><p>
    In HSR, Dunn can shield and counter. Gepard can also shield all allies.
    <!-- this is more enemy design archetypes, put in monster guide -->
  </p>

  <h3>Thief</h3>
  <p>In final fantasy, the thief can steal items from enemies.
    Examples include Locke (ff6) and Zidane (ff9).
    Currently there is no HSR character with a thief ability.
    Moreover, there is no HSR enemy that can rob the character (like the bandits under the Golden Saucer in ff7).
  </p>


  <h3>Abundance</h3>
  <p>Yaoshi is the aeon of abundance, the dao of healing.
    This sometimes manifests itself in other games as white magic or holy white magic (聖白魔法).
    For example, Garnet Til Alexandros XVII or ff9 or Aerith Gainsborough of ff7 are two examples of white magic users (abundance units).
    Garnet / Dagger can also summon eidolons to deal damage and is sometimes designated as part of the 'summoner' job class.
  </p>


  <h2>HSR equivalents in Genshin</h2>
  <p>Natasha has many equivalents in Genshin, such as Barbara.
    Arlan, Blade seem similar to hu tao.
  </p>


  <h2>Seele in Genshin</h2>
  <p>After defeating enemy, reset cd of E skill.</p>


  <h2>Himeko in Genshin</h2>
  <p>The key ability to replicate is Himeko's passive that automatically deals damage with the helicopter razor thing once she obtains 3 stacks.
    She gains a stack every time an enemy weakness is broken.
    In Genshin, not all enemies have gauge shields.
    Perhaps every time an enemy's hp falls below 50%, she gains a stack.
    But toughness meters in HSR can reset.
    We would need something that can reset in Genshin, so that Himeko can continuously gain stacks.
    Alternatively, not every character in HSR need to have an equivalent in Genshin.
