<title>Paths</title>

  </head>
  
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  <p>The path system provides a kind of formula or template for designing characters.
    Just select the path / character role and use that to design the combat abilities.
  </p><p>
    In Genshin, one can split the dps category in two: on-field dps and off-field dps.
  </p>

  <h2>DPS paths</h2>
  <p>Difference between erudition and destruction:
    Xiao, Itto, Cyno are similar characters.
    They are burst dps units that can deal impressive aoe damage against mobs of enemies.
    However, there are some key differences.
    Xiao and Itto are more destruction type characters, sacrificing some of their stats for increased damage,
    whereas Cyno is more of an erudition unit and does not have any such self-sacrificing mechanism.
    Xiao sacrifices his hp (buffs dmg bonus), Itto sacrifices res (buffs atk), but Cyno does not sacrifice anything (just buffs his EM and scalings).
    Xiao and Itto also have 70 energy cost, whereas Cyno has 80 energy cost (but this is a bit less relevant).
  </p>
  <p>The path of destruction is a kind of high-risk high-reward philosophy.
    It is about destruction not just of the enemy, but also of oneself.
    That is why survivability is part of the concept.
    When you create something so powerful that it will mutually hurt both you and your enemy,
    it is important that you are the last person left standing, so you can outlast your enemy.
    You make some sacrifice in exchange for much more power and damage.
    This is symbolized by the Aeon Nanook's path resonance in the simulated universe.
    This is also symbolized by the boss Svarog's move where he overloads one of his hands to self-destruct and hurt the player.
  </p><p>
    During WW2, the Japanese kamikaze pilots employed a similar type of strategy against the allies,
    where they flew suicidal planes to blow up and crash into an enemy, offing themselves in the process.
    Such a tactic does not always lead to victory. The important concept missed in the WW2 case is survivability.
    If you do not survive to begin with, you lose the game.
    So while destruction can be a powerful archetype and have its merits, having an excess amount of it might lead you off the path of survivability.
    It can be wreckless without moderation and lead to unforseen consequences without prudence.
  </p>

  
  <h2>Automatic dps</h2>
  <p>Subdps as automatic dps:
    deals damage without having to be active.
    follow up attacks, counters (himeko, svarog, march) all subdps category.
    in genshin, subdps also sometimes called off-field, but need not be off-field.
    example: can use yae on-field and do nothing but E still does damage.
    main characteristic of subdps is automatic damage / coordinated attack.
  </p><p>
    jing yuan is kind of like a subdps as lightning lord is follow-up / automatic (damage built up by using jing yuan abilities).
    by contrast seele is pure on-field carry.
    luocha heals are automatic (reactive / adaptive / 'smart' healing).
    things that are automatic or allow character to make more moves in a turn are generally considered positive.
  </p>


  <h2>Main path</h2>
  <p>Even though characters can belong to many paths, perhaps one of them is their main path.
    For example, c6 zhongli is a shielder that can heal, while baizhu is a healer that can shield.
    There is a difference. Here zhongli is fundamentally a preservation unit whose main role is to shield, with the healing being reactive and secondary.
    By contrast, baizhu is an abundance unit mainly designed to heal as his shield is complete garbage weak.
  </p>




  <h2>Seele in Genshin</h2>
  <p>After defeating enemy, reset cd of E skill.</p>


  <h2>Himeko in Genshin</h2>
  <p>The key ability to replicate is Himeko's passive that automatically deals damage with the helicopter razor thing once she obtains 3 stacks.
    She gains a stack every time an enemy weakness is broken.
    In Genshin, not all enemies have gauge shields.
    Perhaps every time an enemy's hp falls below 50%, she gains a stack.
    But toughness meters in HSR can reset.
    We would need something that can reset in Genshin, so that Himeko can continuously gain stacks.
    Alternatively, not every character in HSR need to have an equivalent in Genshin.
