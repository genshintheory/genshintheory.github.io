<title>Paths</title>

  </head>
  
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>

  <p>The path system provides a kind of formula or template for designing characters.
    Just select the path / character role and use that to design the combat abilities.
  </p><p>
    In Genshin, one can split the dps category in two: on-field dps and off-field dps.
  </p>

  <h2>DPS paths</h2>
  <p>Difference between erudition and destruction:
    Xiao, Itto, Cyno are similar characters.
    They are burst dps units that can deal impressive aoe damage against mobs of enemies.
    However, there are some key differences.
    Xiao and Itto are more destruction type characters, sacrificing some of their stats for increased damage,
    whereas Cyno is more of an erudition unit and does not have any such self-sacrificing mechanism.
    Xiao sacrifices his hp (buffs dmg bonus), Itto sacrifices res (buffs atk), but Cyno does not sacrifice anything (just buffs his EM and scalings).
    Xiao and Itto also have 70 energy cost, whereas Cyno has 80 energy cost (but this is a bit less relevant).
  </p>
  <p>The path of destruction is a kind of high-risk high-reward philosophy.
    It is about destruction not just of the enemy, but also of oneself.
    That is why survivability is part of the concept.
    When you create something so powerful that it will mutually hurt both you and your enemy,
    it is important that you are the last person left standing, so you can outlast your enemy.
    You make some sacrifice in exchange for much more power and damage.
    This is symbolized by the Aeon Nanook's path resonance in the simulated universe.
    This is also symbolized by the boss Svarog's move where he overloads one of his hands to self-destruct and hurt the player.
  </p><p>
    During WW2, the Japanese kamikaze pilots employed a similar type of strategy against the allies,
    where they flew suicidal planes to blow up and crash into an enemy, offing themselves in the process.
    Such a tactic does not always lead to victory. The important concept missed in the WW2 case is survivability.
    If you do not survive to begin with, you lose the game.
    So while destruction can be a powerful archetype and have its merits, having an excess amount of it might lead you off the path of survivability.
    It can be wreckless without moderation and lead to unforseen consequences without prudence.
  </p>

  
  <h2>Automatic dps</h2>
  <p>subdps as automatic dps,
    deals damage without having to be active.
    follow up attacks, counters (himeko, svarog, march) all subdps category.
    in genshin, subdps also sometimes called off-field, but need not be off-field.
    example: can use yae on-field and do nothing but E still does damage.
    main characteristic of subdps is automatic damage / coordinated attack.
  </p><p>
    jing yuan is kind of like a subdps as lightning lord is follow-up / automatic (damage built up by using jing yuan abilities).
    by contrast seele is pure on-field carry.
    luocha heals are automatic (reactive / adaptive / 'smart' healing).
    things that are automatic or allow character to make more moves in a turn are generally considered positive.
  </p>


  <h2>Main path</h2>
  <p>Even though characters can belong to many paths, perhaps one of them is their main path.
    For example, c6 zhongli is a shielder that can heal, while baizhu is a healer that can shield.
    There is a difference. Here zhongli is fundamentally a preservation unit whose main role is to shield, with the healing being reactive and secondary.
    By contrast, baizhu is an abundance unit mainly designed to heal as his shield is complete garbage weak.
  </p>


  <h2>Character design</h2>
  <p>Svarog is a destruction character that focuses on dmg reduction and counter attacks.
    As of version 3.8, he has no analog in Genshin.
    The only counter type characters so far are Yun Jin, Beidou, Candace.
    And then Dehya and c6 zhongli have similar mechanics where if the character takes damage, they absorb damage and heal.
  </p><p>
    But Genshin could design a similar kind of character as Svarog:
    when the 
  </p>


  <h2>Automatic / reactive healing</h2>
  <p>
    Luocha tends to work favorably with the destruction path
    as well as characters that use a lot of follow-up attacks (Jing Yuan, Himeko, Svarog).
  </p>
  <p>The reactive healer: Luocha is a healer that reacts to when characters fall below a certain hp threshold.
    When he gains 2 stacks of abyss flower, he deploys a field. 
    When the field is active and characters deal damage, they heal the whole party.
    As of version 3.8, Luocha has no analog in Genshin.
    When Jean uses NA she can heal the whole party.
    When Mika uses his Q, he grants a similar effect where characters' NA heal the whole team.
    But there is currently no healer that has a Mika-like effect without needing Q (and that applies to whenever damage is dealt, not just NA).
  </p><p>
    A simple idea for making a Luocha analog (call it LC) in Genshin could be:
    whenever a character's hp falls below 33%, LC heals that character using whatever formula and gains 1 stack of abyss.
    This effect can be triggered once every 10-15s.
    Healing will also remove any debuff on that character (Genshin currently lacks as many debuffs as HSR).
    The E skill has a similar effect, providing healing to a chosen character
    (in Genshin one cannot usually select which character receives the healing, 
    but one can try to make an effect where the healing occurs after 2s to whichever character is on-field, giving time to switch to another character if needed;
    otherwise one can do a healing over time like Yaoyao / Barbara / Kuki E).
    Using E will also grant 1 stack of abyss.
    Once 2 stacks of abyss are obtained, LC will deploy a field / grant an effect to the team where whenever any party member deals damage, they heal the whole party.
    This effect can last 10-15s.
    And then LC's Q can debuff the enemy while dealing aoe damage.
  </p><p>
    Ok that's cool, but is there a need for this kind of healer when characters like kokomi and baizhu exist?
    Maybe.
  </p>
  <p>
    Qiqi is unique in that she can reduce enemy atk. There are few abilities that do this in the game.
    However, HSR has several abilities (nihility class) that can debuff the enemy and remove their atk, dmg bonus buffs.
    Silver Wolf's basic attacks shred enemy def, atk, spd.
    Luocha's burst removes buffs from all enemies.
  </p>


  <h2>Introducing more debuffs into Genshin</h2>
  <p>Every so often, elemental nodes appear in the abyss, granting buffs to certain enemies.
    These buffs could be removed by applying a suitable elemental gauge.
    In the past there used to be debuffs that would reduce character energy (electro) or extend their cd (hydro).
    These could be removed via certain abilities that apply an element to the character itself (thereby cleansing them).
    These include Xinyan E, Kirara E, etc.
    There was also once a corrosion debuff, one of the best things introduced into the game.
  </p>
  <p>These debuffs are some of the most interesting spiral abyss effects and made the game richer.
    One can introduce more kinds of debuffs such as atk reduction, def reduction, res shred, speed reduction.
    HSR has so many debuffs that can be applied to characters.
    Even Kafka can manipulate and make characters attack each other.
