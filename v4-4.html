  <h1>Chenyu vale</h1>
  <p>Chenyu vale will release in 4.4. It contains Qiaoying village (翘英庄).
    King George of the British empire is written 乔治 Qiaozhi in Chinese.
    And the 英 ying character can also symbolize Britain (England).
    Furina, Charlotte, George, Qiaoying.
  </p>
  <p>Chenyu Adeptea is a product of the vale.
    Tea was introduced to Britain from China.
    Port situated close to Fontaine.
    Some of the names use Cantonese romanization, so perhaps the Chenyu Vale area is inspired by the southern coastal regions surrounding Hong Kong
    (and perhaps in general Southeast China).

  <h1>Banners</h1>

  <p>The Xiao-Yae weapon banner is good / pog / pawg.
    So somehow Xinyan is the tailor support for Xiao all along, not Faruzan (/s)?
  </p>

  <p>Everybody knows how valuable and op Nahida is: in general, for hyperbloom, etc.
    Should you pull Xianyun?
    If you are a Xiao main, yes.
    XY is very worth a pull to buff Xiao in ST situations.
    Plus XY's banner has Faruzan.
    If you get C2 XY (Aloof, chef's kiss), that can make C0 Xiao do more damage than almost all C6 units.
    But even without XY, C0 Xiao can already outdamage many C6 units.
  </p><p>
    In a way C2 XY for Xiao is almost like C2 Nahida for Alhaitham/Cyno/hyperbloom.
  </p>
  <p>But to be a Xiao main, one first needs Xiao.
    And we have talked a lot about Xiao's insane (top) dps at C6.
  </p>
    <p>Also XY makes Diluc dragonstrike legit op: Diluc-XY-Furina-Bennett C6 for example works against st bosses.
    So Diluc has been the Dragon of Fire all along.
  </p>


  <h1>Flagship Event</h1>
  <p>Should Paimon's kite contain a confident expression, an afraid one, etc...
    It seems artists are deliberate and conscious of facial expressions when designing art for characters.
    We will keep this in mind.
