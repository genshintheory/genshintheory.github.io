  <h2>Bouncy fungi</h2>
  <p>The bouncy mushroom is a type of Tri-lakshana creature.
  </p>
  <p>Using electro on the fungi will charge them up.
    Jumping on the charged up fungi will allow you to bounce higher.
  </p>

  <p>
    Applying hydro will create a dendro core.
    Applying pyro will burn the mushroom, making it unusable.
    It can be 'revived' by applying dendro on it again.    
  </p>

  <h2>Trilakshana</h2>
  <p>
    Lakshana (लक्षण) can mean symptom, attribute or feature in Tamil.
    So tri-lakshana refers to how the creature can transform into three different states:
    namely a normal (dendro), active (electro), and deactive (pyro) state.
    If they wanted to use Sanskrit roots instead of Greco-Roman,
    they could also write something like Tilakshana.
  </p><p>
    Linguists have proposed that the roots 'tri' in Greek and Roman
    and 'ti' in various Indian languages have a common origin, both meaning 'three'.
    Even the British noticed this when they were in India.
    This is the Aryan hypothesis.
    The Aryans are a group of nomads from north China who migrated west into Europe and India
    more than 4000 years ago (a long time ago).
    They married the local women and fathered many children who lived many generations to this day.
    This is also backed by genetic evidence.
    The male Y-chromosone haplogroup identified with the 'Aryans' is hg R, 
    which is an Asian gene also found in north China.
    Two of the closest relatives of hg R are actually the Chinese haplogroups NO.
    Of course over time, in north China there would be many new nomads like 
    the Scythians, Alans, Xiongnu, Gokturks, Mongols, etc.
    They all had one thing in common: they originated from north China, migrated west, and became part of the local population.
  </p><p>
    But interestingly enough the words 'three', 'tri', 'se' (Persian) are similar to the Chinese word san (三) for three.
    (In linguistics, the /s/ sound and /th/ sound have similar phonetic features.)
    In fact, Chinese shares many similar roots (even cognates) with European languages.
    So if you say European languages and Indo-Aryan languages have a common origin on the basis of these roots,
    you may as well say that European, Indo-Aryan, and the Chinese languages all share a common origin.
  </p>

  <h3>Starshrooms</h3>
  <p>Even starshrooms exhibit trilakshana properties.
    Starshrooms are edible fungi that can be found in the chasm of Liyue and all around Sumeru.
    They have three forms: normal, activated, scorched.
    Apply electro to the starshroom to activate it. It will then restore more hp (800 hp).
    Apply pyro to scorch it. It will then only restore 1 hp.
    Normally it restores 300 hp.
    This is one of the cutest things in the game.
  </p>


  <h2>Other devices</h2>
  <p>The four clover sigils tha allow you to transport to far away places quickly are convenient
    compared to the Inazuma counterparts that required you to carry an electro sigil first
    (and sometimes the Inazuma ones would deactivate temporarily).
  </p>

  <h2>Unlocking Tree of Dreams</h2>
  <p>Following Rana will unlock a pretty long quest chain that gives access to Vanarana and the Tree of Dreams.
    The quest involves clearing various Withering zones and dealing with the Aranara fungi people.
    During the quest, we learn that Rana and the people of Sumeru enjoy making curry, the famous Indian dish.
    This gives more support to Sumeru being based primarily on Indian culture with Arabic/Persian influences.
  </p><p>
    The most annoying thing about this quest is the repetition of the word 'Nara'.
    When people are over-repetitive in an annoying way, they need to be stopped or executed like Rosalyn.
  </p><p>
    So nara apparently means 'human' in Sanskrit (Bhagavad-gita).
    In fact the naradhama form the lowest caste of humankind, which is befitting of the inferiority of nara and nori.
    The naradhama are depraved ignorant vile idiots, the lowest of the low.
    This is an unfortunate feature of the world, and the fact that nara sounds similar to nori is even more unfortunate.
    Nara is the reason why India got colonized by the Brits, similar to how nori is a brainwashed colonial subject of the USA. 
  </p><p>
    On a sidenote, Nara is also where Shinzo Abe got assassinated by that USA puppet.
  </p>

  <h2>Blueprints</h2>
  <p>Stories of You and Aranara are slips of paper that can be exchanged for blueprints.
    The stories can be obtained by completing various quests involving the Aranara.
  </p>
  <p>The midlander billet can be obtained by converting a northlander billet and two dream solvents.
  </p>

  <h3>Vimana Agama</h3>

  <p>One of the quests that gives the aranara story will take you to the ruin golem in southeast Sumeru.
    It will take about 1 hour to complete.
    There we meet a suspicious idiot named Jazari.
    We also meet Royinjan who descends from the legendary Golden Adventurer Hasan.
    We collect parts of a device to reboot the golem, which was built with Khaenriah technology.
    We fight abyss members and a serpent knight named Ynghildr 
    (英 can refer to Britain, so revenge for Opium wars and burning down various palaces).

  <h2>Golden Slumber</h2>
  <p>Released in 3.1, one of the best quests in game to date and very long.
    We get to tour King Deshret's underground ruins in the great desert.
    We enter the palace of Khaj Nisut and meet someone named Samail, who enters the Golden Slumber.
    When the palace starts collapsing, ultimately a merc named Jebrael sacrifices himself 
    to save his daughter Jeht and the traveler and allow them to escape the palace.
  </p><p>
    Samail was the one who killed Jebrael's wife.
    Jebrael is from the Tanit tribe.
  </p><p>
    This quest is required to access various underground chambers in the desert
    as a prism robot named 'Benben' will open some doors to these underground parts.
    The underground contains resources like the golden scarabs for Cyno and a domain (Altar of Mirages).
    This quest also features many of the new optical puzzles introduced in 3.1,
    a testament to the advanced technology from the time of King Deshret.
  </p><p>
    Whereas Golden Slumber was a well-written quest,
    its follow up quest 'Dual Evidence' was more choppy and sloppy.
    There was not as much guidance.
    At the end of 'Dual Evidence' we fight the overseer matrix prism boss at the top of the inverted pyramid.
  </p>


  <h2>Desert of Hadramaveth</h2>
  <p>Released in 3.4, north of Hypostyle pyramid desert, 
    it comes with the Jinni quest as well as 
    Dirge of Bilqis, a continuation of the series with Jeht and the Tanit tribe.
    The whole questline features Babel, Hugeweh, Masseira, etc.
    After completing Bilqis, there is another quest involving reviving the prism Benben with Jeht.
    There is then a quest Fallen Falcon involving Tadhla.
  </p><p>
    This desert has a huge sandstorm in the middle,
    and the Jinni (the slave Liloupar) can help you clear the way through the desert.
  </p><p>
    In 3.6, the boss Apep was added.
  </p>


  <h2>Desert Girdle</h2>
  <p>New desert, new quest, released in 3.6. This desert is northwest of Hadramaveth.
    Placenames sound eerily familiar to some real-life people.
    Temir with a 铁 that is a nice touch, reminiscent of the Timur empire.
    New artifact domain is also here, featuring the dehya E/Q buff HP set and polar star hydro dps set.
  </p><p>
    The main quest involves meeting this flying Pari named Sorush and completing the Rite of Chinvat.
    You can fly up, down, and around with Sorush like a DJI drone (basically like a Scaramouche E mode that lasts longer).
    Sorush can pick up Nirodha fruits and melt the orange Amrita crystals.
  </p><p>
    Certain green spirits Khvarena can help dissolve things encased in gray crystals
    (a result of the black fire, perhaps from the cataclysm).
    Another type of puzzle involves using the Kory drum to play certain beats:
    while using a Kory drum, characters are able to leap further into the air to perform a plunge attack.
  </p>


  <h2>Commissions</h2>
  <p>Gold Devouring and Mora Gathering: meet a guy named Hatim who does derivatives trading (futures)</p>
  <p>For hammering of mushrooms, the autotargeting of Yae's E and Yaoyao's E/Q can help hit multiple mushrooms.
    Huge AoE attacks also work.
  </p>
