  <h2>Bouncy fungi</h2>
  <p>Using electro on the fungi will charge them up.
    Jumping on the charged up fungi will allow you to bounce higher.

  <p>
    Applying hydro will create a dendro core.
    Applying pyro will burn the mushroom, making it unusable.
    It can be 'revived' by applying dendro on it again.    
  </p>

  <h2>Unlocking Tree of Dreams</h2>
  <p>Following Rana will unlock a pretty long quest chain that gives access to Vanarana and the Tree of Dreams.
    The quest involves clearing various Withering zones and dealing with the Aranara fungi people.
    During the quest, we learn that Rana and the people of Sumeru enjoy making curry, the famous Indian dish.
    This gives more support to Sumeru being based primarily on Indian culture with Arabic/Persian influences.
  </p><p>
    The most annoying thing about this quest is the repetition of the word 'Nara'.
    When people are over-repetitive in an annoying way, they need to be stopped or executed like Rosalyn.
  </p><p>
    So nara apparently means 'human' in Sanskrit (Bhagavad-gita).
    In fact the naradhama form the lowest caste of humankind, which is befitting of the inferiority of nara and nori.
    The naradhama are depraved ignorant vile idiots, the lowest of the low.
    This is an unfortunate feature of the world, and the fact that nara sounds similar to nori is even more unfortunate.
    Nara is the reason why India got colonized by the Brits, similar to how nori is a brainwashed colonial subject of the USA. 
  </p><p>
    On a sidenote, Nara is also where Shinzo Abe got assassinated by that USA puppet.

  <h2>Blueprints</h2>
  <p>Stories of You and Aranara are slips of paper that can be exchanged for blueprints.
    The stories can be obtained by completing various quests involving the Aranara.
  </p>
  <p>The midlander billet can be obtained by converting a northlander billet and two dream solvents.
  </p>

  <h2>Vimana Agama</h2>
  <p>One of the quests that gives the aranara story will take you to the ruin golem in southeast Sumeru.
    It will take about 1 hour to complete.
    There we meet a suspicious idiot named Jazari.
    We also meet Royinjan who descends from the legendary Golden Adventurer Hasan.
    We collect parts of a device to reboot the golem, which was built with Khaenriah technology.
    We fight abyss members and a serpent knight named Ynghildr 
    (è‹± can refer to Britain, so revenge for Opium wars and burning down various palaces).
