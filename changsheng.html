  <p>Changsheng (长生), meaning long life, is a snake that accompanies Baizhu.
    Oh no, the voice actors...
    They refer to various people killed by Zhu during the Ming dynasty,
    including Fang Xiaoru, Hu Weiyong, Wang Guangyang, Hu Mei, Zhang Shicheng, etc.
    The Japanese voice actor adds a more personal touch.
    It is the same as the Japanese voice actor for Signora.

    Incidentally, Chang Yuchun also refers to a general of the Ming dynasty.
    Chang was the master of Lan Yu and was intermarried with the House of Zhu.

    There's something funny about the word Yuchun in Chinese.
    In the Qing dynasty, there was a politician named Yang Yuchun.
    In the modern era, there is a celebrity named Li Yuchun.
