  <p>Changsheng (长生), meaning long life, is a snake that accompanies Baizhu.
    Oh no, the voice actors...
    They refer to various people killed by Zhu during the Ming dynasty,
    including Fang Xiaoru, Hu Weiyong, Wang Guangyang, Hu Mei, Zhang Shicheng, etc.
    The Japanese voice actor adds a more personal touch.
    It is the same as the Japanese voice actor for Signora.
  </p><p>
    Incidentally, Chang Yuchun also refers to a general of the Ming dynasty.
    Chang was the master of Lan Yu and was intermarried with the House of Zhu.
  </p><p>
    There's something funny about the word Yuchun in Chinese.
    In the Qing dynasty, there was a politician named Yang Yuchun.
    In the modern era, there is a celebrity named Li Yuchun.
    Now all we need is Zhu Yuchun.
  </p>

  <p>Having someone named Hu voice-act Changsheng makes some sense though:
    even though the Hu family was screwed over and murdered by Zhu,
    some members of the Hu family still cling on to Zhu like a snake.
    Hu is either masochistic or autistic as they seem to like being murdered by Zhu.
    If that's the case, that gives a big hint to leadership that if they ever want to purge, oppress, or contain Hu,
    they can just use Zhu as a reason to purge them, and Hu should just be fine with that
    if they do not know how to resist the very people who murdered their ancestors.

    This is called natural selection.
