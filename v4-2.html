</ul>
<p>As it stands, Version 4.x is by far the worst version to date.
  The versions will not be re-evaluated until...
  If some people want to play the waiting game, we can also play the waiting game.
  Otherwise what is shown above will be the final ratings of version 4.x,
  and you can kiss goodbye to all chances of being better than Sumeru 3.x or Inazuma 2.x.
</p>
<p>After careful consideration, it has been decided to sentence 4.3 to F tier (rather than keep at tentative).
  It would take a miracle for 4.3's rating to improve, but we are cynical.
</p>
<p>After reviewing the events that transpired in the USA this past week (11/16/2023 and before)
  and comparing this to the selection of voice actors for Navia,
  it has been concluded that the devs have intended to release Navia in 4.3
  ever since they first chose her voice actors back around June 2023.
  Moreover, they chose to align all the dates surrounding the 4.3 beta
  in order to make political statements and attacks, to collude with USA and incite separatism, factionalism, and color revolution.
  This planned case of politically-motivated scheduling, combined with the 4.3 beta, 
  is a big reason why 4.3 has been sentenced to F tier.
</p>
<p>4.x has lost all opportunity to be a 'perfect' version (no version below A tier),
  not that it had much of a chance to begin with.
</p>
<p>Certain people's decisions have had a negative impact on the broader community.
  Those who own large media platforms that can reach the lives of people around the world
  need to be held to greater public accountability and responsibility
  as it is too easy for them to abuse their monopoly over media to make political attacks and damage society.
</p>


<h2>A version with no political attacks/questionable decisions can easily be S tier</h2>
<p>In an ideal world, every version would be placed at S or SS tier.
  The fact that some versions fall short and are rated at A, B, or F is more a reflection of certain people's decisions.
  Really, the only person that you should be asking is yourself.
  It is not that this site wants to put versions below S tier.
  It is more that certain people make decisions, even manipulated by USA propaganda, that ruin a version's potential.
</p><p>
  An S tier version should be considered an ideal version, one that gets most of the content done right,
  with no weird political attacks or other things screwing up the presentation of art.
  Put it simply, if you resist your primal urges and do not go out of your way to make a political attack on someone in the story or events,
  then the version can make S tier or above.
  You will get rewarded for simply not doing something stupid or questionable.
</p><p>
  The SS tier rating is a bit more selective. These are only reserved for versions that went above and beyond what is expected of S tier versions.
  An SS version will make people 10-20 years from now look back and remember: this is what made Genshin a great game.
  Being memorable is one thing. But bringing joy, delight, and relaxation to people's life is another characteristic of these versions:
  a feeling of satisfaction, utopia, paradise, bliss, rapture that is just so hard to find these days. 
  Unlike for combat tierlists, the SS rating is not idly given out. It is only for the best of the best.
</p><p>
  They say art is like a mirror, a reflection of the times and the era during which it was made.
  It is a reflection of the people in the world, their relationships, society, politics, the zeitgeist of the world.
  Likewise, this version tierlist is merely a reflection of the actions, choices, and decisions made by artists when they design version content, stories, events, art.
</p>

<h2>Rating definitions</h2>
<p>A tier version is like a passing grade.
  Even if it has flaws, it has some merits too.
  But even among A grades, there can be subtle differences.
  It can be a "congrats you got an A, happy for you",
  or a "here's your A, take it and never come back to me or this class again".
  This site tends to be lenient and not too strict when grading, 
  unless a version goes out of its way to be a jerk (and it seems like many 4.x versions are testing our leniency).
</p><p>
  S tier version is good and can be used as a role model to demonstrate to the class.
  The last S tier version was 2.5, nearly 2 years ago.
  If Fontaine continues down the current path it is taken,
  then perhaps no 4.x version will be S tier.
  But we hope we are proven otherwise.
  It will take a very convincing presentation and compelling performance for this site to put a 4.x version at S tier
  given that no 3.x version made it to S tier.
</p><p>
  SS tier version surpasses expectations.
  It can be published on the cover of the NY Times or however that saying goes.
  All current SS tier versions happened in 2021 (1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.3).
  Based on the performance of Fontaine, there may never be an SS version ever again.
  We hope we are proven otherwise.
</p><p>
  B tier version means there is a major, crippling flaw.
  Something happened in the version that made it undesirable.
</p><p>
  F tier:
  these versions need to be deleted from existence and wiped away from the irminsul.
</p>

<h2>Overall average</h2>
<p>As of the end of 3.8 (including 3.8), the overall average rating of versions is 3.04,
so barely above 3 (A).
This is reflective of the overall rating of Genshin.
An A tier game is fine, gets a passing grade.
An S tier game is something one would recommend to friends to play.
An SS tier game is what you can call a "must-play", setting a standard for the industry, even best of all time.
</p><p>
  How does Genshin compare to other games?
  HL2 would be 4 or 5.
  FF7, FF6 would be above 4, close to 5.
  FF9 would be 4 or 5.
  Most Mario and Pokemon games maybe 4, some 5.
  Bioshock and Bioshock infinite 4 or 5.
</p><p>
In its 1st year, Genshin had a very high rating of a 4.14 average.
It could be recommended to others in 2020 and 2021.
But 2nd and 3rd year (2.2+ Inazuma, Sumeru)
caused a decline in Genshin's rating to below 4,
which means one would not recommend Genshin in 2022 or 2023.
</p>
<p>HSR would be less than 3.
No HSR version would be above 3 (A, except maybe 1.0, but even then...)
which means one would not recommend HSR to others.
</p>
<p>Genshin's peak time probably passed already.
Nowadays everything is too manipulated by USA interference, foreign imperialism, and bribery.
Genshin got severely corrupted over time.
</p>


<h1>AQ</h1>
<p>According to the conversation with Skirk (Surtalogi's disciple and Tartaglia's master), 
  gnosis are created from the remains of the third descender.
  Focalors tricked the Heavenly Principles and destroyed the throne of the hydro archon,
  thereby restoring the stolen elemental authority to the hydro dragon Noctis.
</p><p>
  Also Fontaine people were originally oceanids.
  Egeria fused the primordial water into these oceanids to create artificial veins and humans, similar to mimics.
  However, they were 'incomplete humans'.
  Moreover, Egeria was condemned by Celestia for the 'original sin' of creation.
  And the prophecy is that all the people of Fontaine would be washed away in a flood,
  leaving only the hydro archon remaining, crying on her throne.
</p><p>
  So long as they were 'incomplete' if they came into contact with primordial water, they would be dissolved.
  But once the elemental authority was restored to Noctis,
  he regained control over the hydro element
  and was able to use the dragon authority to grant the Fontaine people true 'blood',
  similar to how life was first brought into the planet.
</p><p>
  According to legend all life in Teyvat was born from this primordial sea.
</p><p>
  And thus Fontaine people became true humans and would no longer be dissolved by primordial water.
</p>

<p>As for Furina, she was created from a part of Focalors when Focalors separated her divinity from her body/spirit.
  Furina took the form of a human being with a human body and spirit,
  while Focalors sealed her divinity into the Oratrice, accruing indemnitium for years to prepare for the final day 
  to stop the prophecy and save the people of Fontaine.
</p><p>
  Focalors was originally one of the oceanids who followed Egeria.
  From in-game lore, Egeria perished in the deserts of Sumeru when she went to fight the abyss,
  and from her the Gaokerena lotus was created.
  Recall that Rene and Jakob discovered their bodies were different from ordinary humans (like Carter)
  based on different results when experimenting with abyssal energies.
  Given that Fontaine people were originally oceanids mixed with primordial water,
  then perhaps Rene and Jakob were these kinds of oceanid creatures as well.
</p><p>
  Question: is there any relationship between the primordial seawater and abyssal energy?
</p><p>
  As for what happened to Focalors, that is admittingly one of the darkest moments in the game.
</p><p>
  Something that is also really dark in the game is the bias and favoritism shown to Navia in the 4.3 beta.
</p>


<h1>Algae Sea WQ</h1>
<p>The conclusion to the Narzissenkreuz WQ has given many answers to questions in previous versions.
  We journey with Seymour, Ann, Cater across the Morte region to restore the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz.
  We enter the Tower of Gestalt (Tower of Ipsissimus), the HQ of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo.
  Centuries ago, the ordo was declared an extremist group that was shut down and sealed away by Alain and Noctis.
  We meet Jakob again at the tower and head downstairs, entering the primordial sea where Narzissenkreuz (Master / Rene) dwells.
  We take Rene to see Mary-Ann, and the quest ends shortly after with people parting their separate ways,
  Seymour returning to Mamere, Cater leaving, etc.
</p><p>
  We learn several things from this:
  1) Rene did turn into an oceanid/tulpa/eidolon being that absorbed the consciousness of others to avert the apocalypse,
  2) Rene seems to be aware of the connection between Childe's narwhal and the prophecy,
  3) Rene's transformation appears to involve the primordial seawater,
  4) Cater does indeed seem to be the reborn form of Carter, the assistant of Alain, 
    and supposedly Rene transplanted Carter's mind into a hilichurl body
    (in Chinese both Cater and Carter are written 卡特 making the link a bit more direct).
</p>
<p>Alain was the genius who invented arkhe and recon log meks (robots). He was also the creator of Seymour.
</p><p>
  In the WQ, it is said that Fontaine had become Alain's world.
  Perhaps it is that Alain and Rene had differing views on how to stop the prophecy.
  Rene pursued the path of dissolving everyone into a single collective consciousness,
  whereas Alain appeared opposed to that, instead siding with the rest of Fontaine, the hydro dragon, etc.
  Eventually, Focalors prevented the prophecy in her own way, and the people of Fontaine were saved from the original sin.
</p><p>
  The ordo was shut down, and Cater was originally sentenced to Meropide for carrying out a deed for his master, Narzissenkreuz (Rene).
</p>


<h1>Cases of discrimination in 4.2</h1>
<p>We will tabulate every instance of discrimination, favoritism, and bias in 4.2 events, story, and media to provide real time feedback.
  The more nit-picky and unforgiving other people are, the more nit-picky we will be as well.
</p><p>
  People are not punching bags. It seems the real people who have grudges are certain devs themselves.
  When people abuse their media platform to make political attacks on others, 
  use the actions of one person to punish the group,
  and discriminate and play favorites based on name,
  it is a sign that a centralized authority needs to step in and fix the situation.
  When private enterprise and corporations begin abusing their monopoly over the media to attack the public,
  that is when a centralized state needs to regulate and audit the industry to ensure social harmony
  and prevent corrupting effects on society, color revolutions, and disorder.
</p><p>
  Moreover, all the choices and attacks made by devs will be reflected in the evaluation of versions.
</p>

<p>Ordering of characters in fanart contest (with Cyno, Focalors, etc.) shows bias and discrimination against characters.</p>
<p>Misty Dungeon: the trial characters placed on the 4th day (as well as the characters placed in the 4th position on each day)
  will reveal the biases and favoritism that certain people have.
  The characters placed on day 1 and 6 also indicate bias and favoritism of people towards certain characters.
  These people only want to put their favorites in the 1st and 6th positions and then discriminate against all other characters.
  It is apparent that certain designers discriminate against characters based on name.
  The 2022 Misty Dungeon determination trial ordered characters based on element,
  but the 2023 determination trial did a different ordering.
  This indicates bias and favoritism, inconsistency and changing ordering to suit personal biases and favorites.
</p>
<p>Banners: ok, so Alexandrina and the Brits did save the Ming and Zhu, so it seems that is the interpretation some devs were going for.
  But to benefit only one part of her name 'rina' without the first part is a scam and injustice.
  And this does not exonerate the crimes committed during the Ming dynasty.
</p><p>
  As such, it has been decided to place a tracker on baizhu.
  From now on in the future, every version baizhu reruns in will automatically be B/F tier unless the banners are chosen appropriately.
  Moreover, it would be a good idea to require all gaming devs to write an essay on what happened to Liu Bowen and Liu Jin during the Ming dynasty.
  Otherwise they can have their gaming license canceled.
</p><p>
  Depending on how future version banners turn out, we may place a similar tracker on Raiden as well 
  given that the previous history of Raiden's reruns appears to show bias and favoritism to certain people.
</p>
<p>Paimon Stickers: arrangement of characters reveals a lot about the creators' biases.
  Paimon Sticker Set 28 shows discrimination against characters based on name, bias and favoritism, abuse of power.
  This has resulted in a penalty for 4.2.
</p>
<p>
  Algae Sea WQ (and Narzissenkreuz WQ in general): contains microagressions in writing of Al, Jak, Jakob.
  These microagressions suggest deep-seated biases, prejudices, and discrimination in the story-writers.
  These also send several red flags that real-life crimes may be committed by such people if they are not put in check.
</p>
<p>Vagrants and Scamps WQ: the storywriters have way too much access to personal and private information.
  Intrusion/invasion of privacy is a crime punishable by law.
  Some people need to have their access to private/confidential info revoked.
</p>
<p>Impromptu Poem of the Crimson Dawn WQ: contains discrimination against name</p>
<p>Archon Quest: ordering of Giverny, Aubenas, Korina in quest indicates bias and favoritism.
  Story of Melus and Silver has resulted in penalty in the rating of 4.2.
</p>
<p>Poisson: what happened to the NPCs here... the designers know what they did, so do not be surprised when 4.2 is penalized for this.</p>
<p>Ordering of characters in "Traveler's Exclusive Interview Handbook" (case record)
  indicates discrimination, bias, favoritism.
</p>
<p>Focalors' SQ (Animula Choragi): portrayal and story of Aurelie indicates one-sided bias, discrimination, favoritism</p>
<p>Local legends: Liam ok, Aur mek ok. Rocky Avildsen, what game are you trying to play with this name? We can read Chinese you know.</p>
<p>On transcription of the 'El' sound: sometimes 厄 is used (Elynas) while other times 艾 is used (Eliphas).
  Certain translators play games with using different characters to write the El sound,
  resulting in political attacks and scams in some cases.
</p>
<p>La vaguelette: selection of singers shows bias and discrimination to people based on name,
  abuses the Liu Yong connection, bias and favoritism to hu
</p>
<p>Ptakhur Narwhal: wasn't there a rumor that this boss was called Ptakhur originally?
  Last minute change shows discrimination, bias, and favoritism to hu,
  abusing the liu yong connection.
  Certain designers seem unwilling to attack or punish hu due to liu yong connection.
  Instead they attack and try to bring down everybody else.
  This is called favoritism and will result in a penalty in 4.x.
</p>
<p>Graph Adversarial Technology Experimental Log (event): Lepin NPC indicates bias and favoritism to Yongle and the Ming dynasty.
  Certain designers play favorites with Chinese dynasties, showing bias and discrimination, not promoting an inclusive or safe environment.
  They even favor smaller dynasties because they think having less territory is a good thing.
  Besides history, such people need to learn common sense.
</p><p>
  The philosophy of certain annoying (讨厌) people working in the entertainment and media industry
  is that when their audience does not like what they are doing,
  instead of stopping they repeat it and keep doing it.
  What do you call these kinds of people? Mentally ill?
  As such people seem to be mentally ill, it is recommended they be inspected for health issues,
  deemed mentally unfit, and then replaced with successors.
  People who are mentally ill and continue to repeat annoying things that others dislike
  are in no position to create entertainment media that is publicized for people around the world to consume.
</p><p>
  Moreover such people abuse their monopoly over media, show bias and favoritism,
  discriminate against people based on name,
  siphon all public and private capital and resources to serve the personal interests of their favorites,
  while oppressing and attacking everybody else.
</p>
