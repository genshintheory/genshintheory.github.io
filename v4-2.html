<p>As it stands, Version 4.x is by far the worst version to date.
  The versions will not be re-evaluated until...
  If some people want to play the waiting game, we can also play the waiting game.
  Otherwise what is shown above will be the final ratings of version 4.x,
  and you can kiss goodbye to all chances of being better than Sumeru 3.x or Inazuma 2.x.
</p>

<p>In an ideal world, every version would be placed at S or SS tier.
  The fact that some versions fall short and are rated at A, B, or F is more a reflection of certain people's decisions.
  Really, the only person that you should be asking is yourself.
  It is not that this site wants to put versions below S tier.
  It is more that certain people make decisions, even manipulated by USA propaganda, that ruin a version's potential.
</p><p>
  An S tier version should be considered an ideal version, one that gets most of the content done right,
  with no weird political attacks or other things screwing up the presentation of art.
  Put it simply, if you resist your primal urges and do not go out of your way to make a political attack on someone in the story or events,
  then the version can make S tier or above.
  You will get rewarded for simply not doing something stupid or questionable.
</p><p>
  The SS tier rating is a bit more selective. These are only reserved for versions that went above and beyond what is expected of S tier versions.
  An SS version will make people 10-20 years from now look back and remember: this is what made Genshin a great game.
  Being memorable is one thing. But bringing joy, delight, and relaxation to people's life is another characteristic of these versions:
  a feeling of satisfaction, utopia, paradise, bliss, rapture that is just so hard to find these days. 
  Unlike for combat tierlists, the SS rating is not idly given out. It is only for the best of the best.
</p><p>
  They say art is like a mirror, a reflection of the times and the era during which it was made.
  It is a reflection of the people in the world, their relationships, society, politics, the zeitgeist of the world.
  Likewise, this version tierlist is merely a reflection of the actions, choices, and decisions made by artists when they design version content, stories, events, art.

<h1>AQ</h1>
<p>According to the conversation with Skirk (Surtalogi's disciple and Tartaglia's master), 
  gnosis are created from the remains of the third descender.
  Focalors tricked the Heavenly Principles and destroyed the throne of the hydro archon,
  thereby restoring the stolen elemental authority to the hydro dragon Noctis.
</p><p>
  Also Fontaine people were originally oceanids.
  Egeria fused the primordial water into these oceanids to create artificial veins and humans, similar to mimics.
  However, they were 'incomplete humans'.
  Moreover, Egeria was condemned by Celestia for the 'original sin' of creation.
  And the prophecy is that all the people of Fontaine would be washed away in a flood,
  leaving only the hydro archon remaining, crying on her throne.
</p><p>
  So long as they were 'incomplete' if they came into contact with primordial water, they would be dissolved.
  But once the elemental authority was restored to Noctis,
  he regained control over the hydro element
  and was able to use the dragon authority to grant the Fontaine people true 'blood',
  similar to how life was first brought into the planet.
</p><p>
  According to legend all life in Teyvat was born from this primordial sea.
</p><p>
  And thus Fontaine people became true humans and would no longer be dissolved by primordial water.
</p>

<p>As for Furina, she was created from a part of Focalors when Focalors separated her divinity from her body/spirit.
  Furina took the form of a human being with a human body and spirit,
  while Focalors sealed her divinity into the Oratrice, accruing indemnitium for years to prepare for the final day 
  to stop the prophecy and save the people of Fontaine.
</p><p>
  Focalors was originally one of the oceanids who followed Egeria.
  From in-game lore, Egeria perished in the deserts of Sumeru when she went to fight the abyss,
  and from her the Gaokerena lotus was created.
  Recall that Rene and Jakob discovered their bodies were different from ordinary humans (like Carter)
  based on different results when experimenting with abyssal energies.
  Given that Fontaine people were originally oceanids mixed with primordial water,
  then perhaps Rene and Jakob were these kinds of oceanid creatures as well.

<h1>Cases of discrimination in 4.2</h1>
<p>We will tabulate every instance of discrimination, favoritism, and bias in 4.2 events, story, and media to provide real time feedback.
</p><p>
  People are not punching bags. It seems the real people who have grudges are certain devs themselves.
  When people abuse their media platform to make political attacks on others, 
  use the actions of one person to punish the group,
  and discriminate and play favorites based on name,
  it is a sign that a centralized authority needs to step in and fix the situation.
  When private enterprise and corporations begin abusing their monopoly over the media to attack the public,
  that is when a centralized state needs to regulate and audit the industry to ensure social harmony
  and prevent corrupting effects on society, color revolutions, and disorder.
</p><p>
  Moreover, all the choices and attacks made by devs will be reflected in the evaluation of versions.
</p>

<p>Ordering of characters in fanart contest (with Cyno, Focalors, etc.) shows bias and discrimination against characters.</p>
<p>Misty Dungeon: the trial characters placed on the 4th day (as well as the characters placed in the 4th position on each day)
  will reveal the biases and favoritism that certain people have.
</p>
<p>Banners: ok, so Alexandrina and the Brits did save the Ming and Zhu, so it seems that is the interpretation some devs were going for.
  But to benefit only one part of her name 'rina' without the first part is a scam and injustice.
  And this does not exonerate the crimes committed during the Ming dynasty.
</p><p>
  As such, it has been decided to place a tracker on baizhu.
  From now on in the future, every version baizhu reruns in will automatically be B/F tier unless the banners are chosen appropriately.
  Moreover, it would be a good idea to require all gaming devs to write an essay on what happened to Liu Bowen and Liu Jin during the Ming dynasty.
  Otherwise they can have their gaming license canceled.
</p><p>
  Depending on how future version banners turn out, we may place a similar tracker on Raiden as well 
  given that the previous history of Raiden's reruns appears to show bias and favoritism to certain people.
</p>
<p>Paimon Stickers: arrangement of characters reveals a lot about the creators' biases</p>
