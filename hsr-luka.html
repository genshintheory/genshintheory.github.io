<title>Luka</title>

  <p>Luka is similar to Kafka in how his debuff works.
    However, Kafka is better in applying her shock debuff in aoe situations,
    whereas Luka is more single target.
  </p><p>
    The 24% hp in Luka's E is a bit deceptive.
    The bleed damage is the minimum of 24% of enemy max hp and a portion of Luka's atk.
    So for enemies with low max hp, bleed may do less absolute damage than for high max hp enemies.
    This will be the case until a certain critical point where 24% max hp is equal to the atk scaling limit of the bleed debuff.
  </p><p>
    By contrast, Kafka's shock debuff just scales with her atk, without having this hp restriction.
    It does the same absolute damage regardless of enemy hp.
