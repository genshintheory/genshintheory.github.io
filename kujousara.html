<title>Kujou Sara</title>

  <p>
    Kujou Sara, servant of the Raiden Shogun, is an electro buffer and ATK buffer.
    Her C6 buffs electro crit dmg.
    Otherwise her ATK buff is shorter and not as powerful as Bennett's.
    But Sara's main use is buffing electro and dendro quicken teams,
    where she can act as a Bennett substitute (especially since pyro can break the quicken state).
  </p><p>
    The fact that her special material is Dendrobium
    hints at her use in dendro teams.
  </p>


  <h2>Talents</h2>

  <h3>Skill</h3>
  <p>After using her E (10s cd), she will retreat a distance and gain crowfeather cover. 
    When she fires a CA, it will create a crowfeather at a position, which will explode after a short time,
    dealing damage while also giving an ATK buff to characters within the AoE.
    The ATK buff will scale with Sara's base ATK (like Bennett's buff).
    However, unlike Bennett's buff, Sara's ATK buff is less and only lasts 6s.
    This is tradeoff for having an ATK buff on the E (does not require energy).
  </p><p>
    With her C6, the ATK buff will also increase electro crit dmg by 60%.
    So Sara's main use is more of an electro dps buffer rather than a pure Bennett replacement.
    Outside of buffing electro characters, she can buff the ATK of dendro characters in quicken or hyperbloom teams
    (that do not have Bennett).
    One example is using Sara to buff the ATK of a quickswap Alhaitham.
  </p><p>
    The 6s duration of Sara's ATK buff does not even cover Raiden's 7s burst duration.
    But it covers most of Raiden's burst window so that one may often see the Raiden-Sara duo in teams.
    Other than Raiden, Sara can support burst Yae and other electro dps.
    Sara can support Cyno, but Cyno's burst lasts 18s so he will not be buffed for the whole duration.
    Showcases involving Cyno with Sara typically are for speed clears of bosses or the abyss.
  </p><p>
    However, Beidou can snapshot Sara's ATK buff for the duration of her burst (but not the crit buff),
    so Beidou-Sara does have synergy.
  </p><p>
    With Sara's C2, when she uses her E, it will leave a crowfeather at her original position 
    (that deals 30% of the damage but still grants the same ATK buff).
    This essentially eliminates the extra step of having to fire a CA.
  </p><p>
    With her C1, whenever her E or Q hit opponents or grant ATK buffs,
    it will decrease her E cd by 1s (can happen once per 3s).
    But given her E has 10s cd, this cd reduction does not amount to much.
  </p>

  <h3>Burst</h3>
  <p>
    Sara's burst (80 energy) does a nuke of damage and can provide the same ATK buff as her E.
    The nuke is similar to Cyno's buffed E: it will do a nuke of AoE damage followed by several bolts that spread out.
    Sara's burst will spread out into 4 stormclusters.
    With C4, this becomes 6.
  </p>

  <h2>Build</h2>
  <p>Use a high base ATK bow such as Elegy or Skyward Harp to maximize the ATK buff.
    Otherwise, one can do standard damage build ATK-Electro-Crit on artifacts with emphasis on ER.
    One can opt for ER sands too.
    One can also try a full EM build.
    Many artifact sets can even be used: Noblesse, Emblem, Gilded, Instructor, TF, even Deepwood (for supporting dendro teams).
    But in the end, the most important thing is to give Sara a high base ATK weapon.
  </p>

  <h2>Teams</h2>
  <p>Raiden/Yae-Sara-Anemo-Bennett,
    Cyno-Nahida-Sara-Anemo,
    Alhaitham-Nahida-Sara.
