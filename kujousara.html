  <p>
    Kujou Sara, servant of the Raiden Shogun, is an electro buffer and ATK buffer.
    Her C6 buffs electro crit dmg.
    Otherwise her ATK buff is shorter and not as powerful as Bennett's.
    But Sara's main use is buffing electro and dendro quicken teams,
    where she can act as a Bennett substitute (especially since pyro can break the quicken state).
  </p>

  <h2>Skills</h2>
  <p>After using her E (10s cd), when she fires a CA,
    it will create a crowfeather at a position, which will explode after a short time,
    dealing damage while also giving an ATK buff to characters within the AoE.
    The ATK buff will scale with Sara's base ATK (like Bennett's buff).
    However, unlike Bennett's buff, Sara's ATK buff is less and only lasts 6s.
    This is tradeoff for having an ATK buff on the E (does not require energy).
  </p><p>
    With her C6, the ATK buff will also increase electro crit dmg by 60%.
    So Sara's main use is more of an electro dps buffer rather than a pure Bennett replacement.
  </p><p>
    The 6s duration of Sara's ATK buff does not even cover Raiden's 7s burst duration.
    But it covers most of Raiden's burst window so that one may often see the Raiden-Sara duo in teams.
    Other than Raiden, Sara can support burst Yae and other electro dps.
    Sara can support Cyno, but Cyno's burst lasts 18s so he will not be buffed for the whole duration.
    Showcases involving Cyno with Sara typically are for speed clears of bosses or the abyss.
  </p><p>
    Sara's burst (80 energy) does a nuke of damage and can provide the same ATK buff as her E.
  </p>

  <h2>Build</h2>
  <p>Use a high base ATK bow such as Elegy or Skyward Harp to maximize the ATK buff.</p>
