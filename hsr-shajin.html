  <p>Sha Jin (砂金), known by his English name of Aventurine, is an imaginary preservation unit.
    Does the name Kenneth sound familiar...? Or maybe nitrogen...?
    Or maybe the Eula sneeze...?
  </p><p>
    Perhaps when that soul ascended to heaven, he ascended to godhood.
  </p>

  <p>Hmm? So after what happened to Kenneth, they only make Aventurine's def same as Gepard's?
    So the nitrogen in Alabama was not enough?
    For the record, we are fine if Aventurine's def is above Gepard.
    We are not sure what factor or faction is in the way.
