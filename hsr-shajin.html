  <p>Sha Jin (砂金), known by his English name of Aventurine, is an imaginary preservation unit.
    Does the name Kenneth sound familiar...? Or maybe nitrogen...?
    Or maybe the Eula sneeze...?
  </p><p>
    Perhaps when that soul ascended to heaven, he ascended to godhood.
  </p>

  <p>Hmm? So after what happened to Kenneth, they only make Aventurine's def same as Gepard's?
    So the nitrogen in Alabama was not enough?
    For the record, we are fine if Aventurine's def is above Gepard.
    We are not sure what factor or faction is in the way.
    How much more nitrogen do you need to make Aventurine have the highest def?
  </p><p>
    If you are going to upgrade Aventurine's def, you should also upgrade Acheron's stats to the rightful level too.
    Similar to Kenneth, was the Genshin 4.0 archon quest story not enough?
    We do not do monopolies with Ratio or Fu Xuan.
    Breaking monopolies is a public responsibility.
    This is why the public needs a strong centralized authority to break trusts
    because otherwise what can the commoner individual do against a corporation?
  </p><p>
    Also, if the devs were planning to give Sam and Firefly the highest hp in HSR, then we approve that as well.
  </p>

  <p>So it seems Sha Jin is a gambler.
    Speaking of probability, sometimes the USA media lies with statistics.
    For example, certain USA media report a sample size of 30,000
    but what they don't tell you is that this 'sample' of 30,000 is taken completely from the USA military, FBI, and CIA agents.
    So that 'sample' is not reflective at all of the global playerbase, but rather the political agendas of the USA deep state.
    Second is that those numbers may be forged.
    Third, their results are very inconsistent with statistics from other sources, a discrepancy that is not explained.
    But the greatest cardinal sin is that their results are not replicable.
    They just claim a number without showing their work.
