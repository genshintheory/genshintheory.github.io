  <p>Simulated Universe (SU) is a form of endgame in HSR.
    It appears eerily similar to the dungeon event introduced in version 2.2 of Genshin.
  </p>

  <h2>General remarks</h2>
  <p>In world 3 with the fight against Gepard, selecting the path of preservation helps.
    In world 4 with the Svarog fight, destruction can help 
    (a powerful shield/healing will not save you from being trapped by one of Svarog's hands; survivability is important here).
    In the world with the Kafka fight, abundance can help.
  </p>

  <p>In one of the rooms, there is a chance to get all the blessings of one path (such as elation).
    Such a buff can be quite broken.
  </p>

  <p>Progress to the point where you can start selecting path resonances (1-2).
    This will help a lot with boss fights.
  </p>

  <p>Two nonplayable paths are present: remembrance (buff freeze) and elation (buff follow-up attacks).
    Erudition and harmony are not present.
  </p>

  <p>Nice buffs:
    recover skill point when using follow up attack (elation),
    increase eidolon level (curio),
    flowing mist (upgrading gives chance to recover sp)
