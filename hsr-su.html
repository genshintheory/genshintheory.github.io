<title>Simulated Universe</title>

  <p>Simulated Universe (SU) is a form of endgame in HSR.
    It appears eerily similar to the dungeon event introduced in version 2.2 of Genshin.
  </p>

  <h2>General remarks</h2>
  <p>In world 3 with the fight against Gepard, selecting the path of preservation helps.
    In world 4 with the Svarog fight, destruction can help 
    (a powerful shield/healing will not save you from being trapped by one of Svarog's hands; survivability is important here).
    In the world with the Kafka fight, abundance can help.
  </p>

  <p>In one of the rooms, there is a chance to get all the blessings of one path (such as elation).
    Such a buff can be quite broken.
  </p>

  <p>Progress to the point where you can start selecting path resonances (1-2).
    This will help a lot with boss fights.
  </p>

  <p>Two nonplayable paths are present: remembrance (buff freeze) and elation (buff follow-up attacks).
    Erudition and harmony are not present.
  </p>

  <p>Nice buffs:
    recover skill point when using follow up attack (elation),
    increase eidolon level (curio),
    flowing mist (upgrading gives chance to recover sp)
  </p>


  <h2>Paths</h2>
  <p>Version 1.6 added the Erudition path, which seems to buff ultimate dmg (good for Argenti).
    Other erudition dps like Jing Yuan, Himeko seem to have more FUA though,
    so Elation suit them more.
  </p><p>
    There is also the Propagation path, which gives buffs to sp economy and basic atk,
    so it probably is for Qingque / Lunae.
