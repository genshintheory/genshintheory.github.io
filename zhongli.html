<p>Press: creates a pillar that can resonate with other Geo constructs. The resonance does 0 poise damage.
</p><p>Hold: creates a shield that scales off Zhongli's max HP and reduces all RES of enemies by 20%
</p><p>With A1, shield can fortify.

<li>Shield can also heal (converts 40% of incoming damage to HP): only good for especially Xiao, useless for most other characters, and even bad for Hu Tao. Some people liken C6 Zhongli for Hu Tao to a C6 Bennett for Physical carries.</li></ol>

<p>4 piece Tenacity is considered his BiS. That said, some people complain about the 4 piece not always proccing.
</p><p>Some alternatives are:
</p>
<ul><li>2 piece Tenacity, 2 piece Noblesse</li>
<li>2 piece Archaic, 2 piece Noblesse</li>
<li>4 piece Bolide</li>
<li>Other combos of these 4 main sets</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Artifact_Stats">Artifact Stats</span></h3>
<p>Zhongli is best used as a support. He has two main builds:
</p>
<ul><li>HP sands, Geo DMG Bonus goblet, CRIT circlet (an ATK sands is ok but an HP sands benefits from the stronger shield and HP to DMG conversion from his A4): a generalist build if you care about his damage as well as his shield</li>
<li>HP sands, HP goblet, HP circlet (full shield slave 60k HP kind of build): if you only care about his shield</li></ul>
<p>Substats: CRIT, HP, ATK, ER
</p><p>Unlike Albedo, Itto, and other DEF scaling Geo characters, Zhongli usually wants HP rather than DEF and does not benefit that much from more DEF.

<dl><dt>5 stars</dt></dl>
<ul><li>Vortex Vanquisher: the weapon designed for him is ok. Some people are very passionate about VV though.</li>
<li>Skyward Spine: a common choice for ER and burst spam</li>
<li>Homa: good for building damage with CRIT DMG and HP-scaling passive. However, Homa is usually contested with Hu Tao and Xiao.</li>
<li>PJWS: decent stat stick giving high base ATK and CRIT rate</li></ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Teams">Teams</span></h2>
<p>As a shield bot, there are not really any teams where Zhongli particularly shines or stands out. However, there are some DPS units who benefit greatly from his shield:
</p>
<ul><li>Xiao: benefits from Anemo RES shred, which currently only Zhongli provides at C0 (Anemo Traveler, Venti, Jean do it at higher constellations)</li>
<li>Hu Tao: likes having a shield when under 50% HP. However, she can also use Thoma.</li>
<li>Geo teams: usually when paired with Itto or Albedo for Geo resonance</li></ul>
<p>Note many teams such as Morgana, Hu Tao-Thoma-Xingqiu-Kazuha, Childe-Xiangling do not need Zhongli at all. The -20% RES shred he provides is powercrept by Viridescent Venerer (Anemo swirl units) and Superconduct. Even Geo units already benefit from the Geo shred from Geo resonance.
</p><p>As a shield unit, though his shield has high scaling, many other teams usually prefer a different shielder such as Diona or Thoma. Many of these other teams need more offense rather than defense and can already take advantage of an Anemo unit for VV shred and CC, rendering Zhongli as unnecessary.
</p><p>That said, there is one DPS unit for which Zhongli is more or less irreplaceable (cannot find a better option): that is for Xiao teams. For Xiao specifically, he can use Diona for the shield and healing, but the Anemo RES shred provided by Zhongli is usually more valuable. Plus, Xiao gets by with other healers such as Bennett, Jean, and even TTDS Barbara.
</p><p>Note Xiao will still do high DPS even without Zhongli, but Zhongli's shield can amplify Xiao's damage to the next level, whereas other DPS units can just use VV shred or Superconduct and not use Zhongli.
</p><p>Moreover, C6 Zhongli is basically made to counter Xiao's health drain. As of Version 2.3, Zhongli is as close as one gets to a perfect Xiao support. It also makes sense story-wise.
  <p>Expanding on this note: at C0, Pyro/Hydro/Cryo/Electro all can get -40% RES from VV anemo swirl. Physical can get -40% RES from Superconduct.
    Even Geo can get -20% RES from Geo Resonance.
    But the only way to reduce Anemo RES is Zhongli, and that is by -20%.
    It is true that Anemo Traveler C6 reduces RES by -20% on the burst, but that is technically not C0. 
    Even though it is F2P, tying the shred to the Anemo Traveler's burst makes it less convenient than VV, Superconduct, or Zhongli's shield.
    This is why Xiao arguably needs Zhongli the most, more than Hu Tao, Ganyu, Eula, Itto, etc.
    In compensation for this, Xiao's scalings and DMG Bonus are much higher than these other units.
  </p><p>
  Above C0, for Anemo RES specifically, Zhongli gets powercrept by Jean and Venti.
