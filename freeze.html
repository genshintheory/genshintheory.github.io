<p>Freeze teams are a type of team based on immobilizing enemies 
  and taking advantage of the crit rate buff from the blizzard set and cryo resonance.
  They are usually composed of two cryo characters, one hydro, and one anemo (for vv/swirl/cc, etc). 
</p><p>
  Freeze teams have two main drawbacks: 
  1) not every enemy can be frozen and 
  2) they usually do not make use of Bennett's broken atk buff,
  which results in a penalty in their team dps.
</p><p>
  Oftentimes when freeze teams do work, it basicall becomes an Anemo cc/vv showcase.
