  <p>The Daoguang emperor (道光帝) of the Qing dynasty
    was born Aisin Gioro Mianning (爱新觉罗绵宁).
    Put Ning and Guang together and you get Ningguang.
  </p><p>
    Daoguang was also the emperor that lost to Alexandrina Victoria's British Empire in the Opium Wars.
    Like literally, Daoguang dumped a bunch of British opium (grown in India) into the ocean.
    And then Alexandrina Victoria (who was only around 20 and newly coronated) declared war on Daoguang and the Qing dynasty.
    And the British won.
  </p><p>
    Does Ningguang look like a character that would smoke opium?
    Maybe.
  </p><p>
    The Qing dynasty is widely regarded as one of China's most powerful empires in history.
    And during the reign of Kangxi or Qianlong, the Qing could put up a fight against the British and Europeans and even win.
    In fact during the 1700s and Qianlong era, it was the British that was paying silver tribute to the Qing.
    However, the period from Daoguang and after saw the decline of the Qing and rise of a new era.

  <p>Besides that, Ningguang may be a reference to a certain novel.</p>
  <p>In the game, Ningguang is known for the Jade Chamber, the floating palace in the sky.</p>
