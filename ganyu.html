<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Talents">Talents</span></h2>
<p>Ganyu has a 2nd level CA that does aoe cryo damage.
  This can be convenient in overworld.
  Her E is a taunt.
  Her Q does dot and buffs cryo dmg, so she can be a support for Ayaka even (which seems to be a popular pairing).
  The Q has <a href=scaling.html>pseudo-quadratic scaling</a> (not true quadratic scaling like Childe E).
</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Constellations">Constellations</span></h2>
<p>Ganyu's constellations are mediocre and overall not worth pulling for:
</p>
<ol><li>C1: using level 2 charged shot reduces Cryo RES of target by 15%, which is underwhelming and hits diminishing returns especially if using Viridescent Venerer (-40% RES) or Zhongli's shield (-20% RES)</li>
<li>C2: gains an extra charge on her E, which is underwhelming</li>
<li>C3: extra 3 levels on Q</li>
<li>C4: opponents within Q take increased damage that stacks. Xiao's ascension passive does something very similar at C0. So Ganyu's C4 upgrade is basically what Xiao intrinsically has without constellations.</li>
<li>C5: extra 3 levels on E, which is whatever</li>
<li>C6: using E allows next charged shot in next 30 seconds to not require charging. One of the worst C6 in the game, extremely underwhelming. Compare this to Xiao's C6 which allows him to spam Es in the next 1s.</li></ol>
  
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Weapons">Weapons</span></h2>
<p>Ganyu's signature Amos bow appears to reference Amos Yee. 
  Other than that prototype R5, great magic, thundering pulse, even aqua simulacra can work, 
  though they do not have as much synergy, which limits her viability.
</p>
  
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Teams">Teams</span></h2>
<p>As a DPS, Ganyu lacks a perfect support, lacks team synergy, and is powercrept by many other units. Most of her supports are more efficiently used in other teams.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dehya/Xiangling: better used in Tartaglia teams</li>
<li>Zhongli: better used in Hu Tao and Xiao teams</li>
<li>Diona: more efficiently used in Eula teams</li>
<li>Venti: more efficiently used in Ayaka teams</li>
<li>Mona: more efficiently used in Ayaka teams</li>
<li>Bennett: more efficiently used in Xiangling, Xiao teams. Ganyu will often walk out of the Bennett circle.</li>
<li>Kazuha: better used in Hu Tao, Tartaglia teams</li>
<li>Sucrose: more efficiently used in Xiao teams</li>
<li>Nahida: used in the niche burning melt Ganyu team, 
but it is no surprise that Nahida is more effectively used in pretty much any other team</li>
<li>Furina: better used in Xiao teams</li>
</ul>

<p>As a support, Ganyu is powercrept by many other units: Venti, Bennett, Kazuha, Zhongli, etc. She is not even top 10 as a support.
</p><p>Ganyu does not particularly excel in either category and is vastly overhyped by the community, USA NGOs, and biased media portrayal. This puts her in a lower tier than other units. She never was and never will be meta.
</p>
<p>The Morgana team: Mona-Ganyu-Diona-Venti.</p>
<p>Melt team: Dehya/XL-Nahida-Ganyu-Bennett.</p>
<p>Another freeze team: Charlotte/Barbara/Kokomi-Furina-Ganyu-Venti.</p>
<p>Freeze-melt: Charlotte-Furina-Ganyu-Bennett, it can work.</p>
<p>For freeze build she can use blizzard 4p.
  For melt build she can use wanderer 4p.
  If paired with Furina (for say freeze), she may be able to use Marechausse, but why bother? 
  Blizzard gives more crit rate to her.
</p>

<p>Ganyu's advantages over Lyney is that she has aoe on CA and can melt.
  But she may not have the same amount of dmg bonus as Lyney.
</p>


<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Calculations">Calculations</span></h2>
<p>We assume talent level 10 on the charged attack. We also assume Ganyu is wearing a 4-piece Wanderer's with Cryo DMG Bonus (up to \( 46.6+35=81.6\) DMG Bonus). Note a 4-piece Blizzard Strayer gives less DMG Bonus. We assume that she is not using her burst, and we ignore weapon effects as in Xiao's case.
</p><p>It takes 3 seconds for Ganyu to do a fully charged 2nd level shot. The DPS scaling for one level 2 shot is
</p>
<dl><dd>\( x_C =(1+.816)*(230+392)/3\approx 376.52 \)</dd></dl>
<p>This is much lower than Xiao's high plunge DPS. Even if you add the DMG Bonus from her burst it is not enough to reach Xiao's level.
</p>

<h3>Melt (Dehya is Ganyu's best support here)</h3>
<p>Ganyu melt teams look like:
  Dehya-Nahida-Bennett-Ganyu (burn melt),
  Dehya-Bennett-Kazuha-Ganyu (anemo melt).
</p><p>
  N.B. It seems Ganyu feels safer around Kazuha since Niwa (丹羽 Dan Yu) was revealed to be Kazuha's ancestors.
  But as revealed in the 3.3 Scaramouche quest, Niwa was killed by Dottore (disguised as Escher).
</p>
<p>Melt Ganyu usually involves 4p WT and vaping her CA.
  This requires a pyro support such as Dehya or XL.
  Within Dehya's 12s E, Ganyu can vape around 4 of her CA.
  It is almost a coincidence that Dehya's E also procs 4 times within that interval...
  Anyways, C6 XL 14s window does not offer much since in practice Ganyu will still vape around 4 CA
  (taking ~3s average to fire a full lv2 CA).
  Moreover, XL has a huge 80 energy cost, while Dehya's E is free pyro application.
  As such, Dehya is a superior support to melt Ganyu.
  Dehya's C2 (18s window) widens the gap even further, becoming the best, longest-lasting, and most economical 
  pyro application over time in the game.
</p><p>
  But no matter how meta or good Dehya is, not even a goddess can save a miserable F tier depraved soul like Ganyu.
</p><p>
  A naive calculation would assume for Ganyu melt just multiply her dps by 1.5.
  But that assumes you have 100% uptime on pyro application
  when in reality there is always a limit.
  Dehya's pyro app lasts 12s at c0. XL's pyro app lasts 10s at c0.
  Burning is not too reliable for Ganyu melt (especially since burning was nerfed in 3.0 beta).
  And anemo absorption off-field abilities (Venti q, Kazuha q)
  will not last as long as Dehya's E.
  So Ganyu melt will have a cd (unless you have Dehya c2).
</p><p>
  Suppose within a 20s window, Ganyu can melt 4 CA, does 1 nonmelt CA, and the rest of the time is used for setup.
  Then the dps is
  $$x_m = 376.52*3*(4*1.5+1)/20 = 395.3$$
  It is not much of an increase, frankly.
  And it's actually lower than Xiangling's dps, which is quite sad for a non-standard banner 5 star.
  Maybe Ganyu should have joined fellow underwhelming CA dps Tighnari on the standard banner too.
</p>

<h3>Burst</h3>
<p>
  Usually her disco ball is only used in freeze comps where Ganyu has blizzard strayer for 61.6% cryo dmg bonus
  (as otherwise it can mess up melt teams).
  We assume level 10 burst for 126.49% scaling per icicle.
</p><p>
  If there is one enemy, 10 icicles will hit.
  If there are two, 20 icicles will hit (spread between 2 enemies), and so on.
  This caps out at 50 max if there are 5 or more enemies.
  However, it is usually not the case that there are always 5+ enemies.
  Suppose there are 2 enemies in an average situation.
  In other words, suppose 20 icicles hit.
  But not all of them hit every enemy. They are generated pseudorandomly.
  To get all icicles to hit every enemy, one usually needs CC like Venti.
  Let's say in practice, about half of them hit every enemy.
</p><p>
  The burst lasts 15s. The dps is
</p>
<dl><dd>\( x_Q = 1.616*(20/2)*126.49/15 \approx 136.3 \)</dd></dl>
<p>In practice, the dps will be much less, since not every icicle is guaranteed to hit the enemy.</p>

<p>As Ayato's burst is similar, a similar type of analysis applies for her as well.</p>
