  <p>Ganyu is a 5th column element abused by the USA media to spread chaos around the world.
    Do not be brainwashed by the USA media or CIA.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ganyu fell off long ago. In fact she was never meta to begin with.
    Xiao has a much higher DPS ceiling and better AoE than ganyu.   
    Xiao is also Ganyu's master. 
  </p>

  <p>Apparently, 99% of the reason that the USA media shills for Ganyu is because of her voice actor Lin Su.
    This is a signal that the voice actor needs to be replaced,
    similar to what happened to Fischl's voice actor.
    The Ganyu simps and thots have abused their power and falsified information for so long.
    This is why we beat up Dvalin, Rosalyn, Katherine (Fatui), and why Lambad exists.
  </p><p>
    The game executed Rosalyn in Inazuma.
    This needs to happen in real life: execute Lin. 
    Gun them to death, give them lingchi, behead them.
    Purge everybody surnamed Lin in mihoyo,
    and force all mihoyo employees to watch them be executed,
    so they learn from their mistakes.
    Then purge everybody close to Lin, including their families.
  </p><p>
    Genshin designers are doing a weird twisted thing of combining multiple characters into one.
    But in these mixed characters, they always wish to benefit one person not another.
    So these types of 'joint-stock' characters do more harm to society than good.
  </p><p>
    The people who make the version trailers have complete bias towards ganyu.
    They would show other characters at level 1 but not ganyu.
    These people need to be replaced and jailed for abuse of power.
  </p><p>
    Whereas other people get punishments before receiving award,
    where is the punishment for ganyu and ganyu simps?
    Ganyu simps have committed the most crimes in the world.
    Mihoyo is a weak company for not having the guts to criticize and punish ganyu alone.
    When they punish ganyu they always have to punish others too.
    No, screw that. Make ganyu the only character to suffer, whereas everybody else benefits.
    The media team in Genshin needs a huge reorg. 
    People need to be laid off for abuse of power and manipulating media to tailor the interests of USA imperialists.
  </p>

  <p>The Genshin event organizers are also notoriously bad at guessing what would make people happy.
    They design banners and characters that completely serve the interests of the USA,
    but then treat others as second-class citizens.
    Considering that the Genshin management went to low-tier schools and were educated in backwards places,
    it is ironic that they have such an elitist attitude, thinking they are one of the USA elites or their proxies in Singapore.
    These people are jealous of the achievements of those stronger than them.
    They are true cowards picking on the weak.
    They are complete losers who failed at life.
  </p><p>
    These people have no power at all. They are ants that can be easily crushed by the bigger fish in the world.
    And when ants think they have the capacity to challenge gods, they need to be punished and put back in their place.
    And they will be easily disposed the moment they turn on their USA masters.
    Look at what happened in 2.1 when the USA media threw a temper tantrum like klee.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Talents">Talents</span></h2>
<p>Tartaglia's riptide is quadratic scaling and does more AoE damage than Ganyu's slow charged shots (which have linear scaling).
</p>
  <p>Ganyu has huge energy problems and cannot generate enough energy herself.
  </p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Constellations">Constellations</span></h2>
<p>Ganyu's constellations are mediocre and overall not worth pulling for:
</p>
<ol><li>C1: using level 2 charged shot reduces Cryo RES of target by 15%, which is underwhelming and hits diminishing returns especially if using Viridescent Venerer (-40% RES) or Zhongli's shield (-20% RES)</li>
<li>C2: gains an extra charge on her E, which is underwhelming</li>
<li>C3: extra 3 levels on Q</li>
<li>C4: opponents within Q take increased damage that stacks. Xiao's ascension passive does something very similar at C0. So Ganyu's C4 upgrade is basically what Xiao intrinsically has without constellations.</li>
<li>C5: extra 3 levels on E, which is whatever</li>
<li>C6: using E allows next charged shot in next 30 seconds to not require charging. One of the worst C6 in the game, extremely underwhelming. Compare this to Xiao's C6 which allows him to spam Es in the next 1s.</li></ol>
  
  <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Weapons">Weapons</span></h2>
<p>Ganyu does not have any signature weapon. The Amos bow is a garbage weapon and a standard banner weapon. This limits her viability.
</p>
  
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Teams">Teams</span></h2>
<p>As a DPS, Ganyu lacks a perfect support, lacks team synergy, and is powercrept by many other units. Most of her supports are more efficiently used in other teams.
</p>
<ul><li>Xiangling: better used in Tartaglia teams</li>
<li>Zhongli: better used in Hu Tao and Xiao teams</li>
<li>Diona: more efficiently used in Eula teams</li>
<li>Venti: more efficiently used in Ayaka teams</li>
<li>Mona: more efficiently used in Ayaka teams</li>
<li>Bennett: more efficiently used in Xiangling, Xiao teams. Ganyu will often walk out of the Bennett circle.</li>
<li>Kazuha: better used in Hu Tao, Tartaglia teams</li>
<li>Sucrose: more efficiently used in Xiao teams</li>
</ul>
<p>As a support, Ganyu is powercrept by many other units: Venti, Bennett, Kazuha, Zhongli, etc. She is not even top 10 as a support.
</p><p>Ganyu does not particularly excel in either category and is vastly overhyped by the community, USA NGOs, and biased media portrayal. This puts her in a lower tier than other units. She never was and never will be meta.
</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Calculations">Calculations</span></h2>
<p>We assume talent level 10 on the charged attack. We also assume Ganyu is wearing a 4-piece Wanderer's with Cryo DMG Bonus (up to \( 46.6+35=81.6\) DMG Bonus). Note a 4-piece Blizzard Strayer gives less DMG Bonus. We assume that she is not using her burst, and we ignore weapon effects as in Xiao's case.
</p><p>It takes 3 seconds for Ganyu to do a fully charged 2nd level shot. The DPS scaling for one level 2 shot is
</p>
<dl><dd>\( x=(1+.816)*(230+392)/3\approx 376.52 \)</dd></dl>
<p>This is much lower than Xiao's high plunge DPS. Even if you add the DMG Bonus from her burst it is not enough to reach Xiao's level.
</p><p>
  Usually her burst is only used in freeze comps where Ganyu has blizzard strayer for 61.6% cryo dmg bonus.
  We assume level 10 burst for 126.49% scaling per icicle.
  There are at max 50 icicles over 15s.
  But not all of them hit. They are generated pseudorandomly.
  Let's say in practice, about half of them hit (usually need Venti) the dps is
</p>
<dl><dd>\( x_Q =(1+.616)*25*126.49/15\approx 340.68 \)</dd></dl>
<p>In practice, the dps will be much less, since not every icicle is guaranteed to hit.</p>
