  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>The lands in the western parts and beyond of China
    were sometimes referred to as the Xiyu (西域),
    which literally translated means 'western regions'.
    The western regions play a huge role in China's history 
    as well as understanding the region of Sumeru and its relationship to Liyue and China.
  </p><p>
    In fact, to be even more direct, some may even equate the 'western regions' (Xiyu) with Sumeru itself.
  </p>

  <h2>Han dynasty</h2>
  <p>The Han dynasty (汉朝) was the first large Chinese dynasty in written history
    that conquered the western regions (or at least established hegemony over the region).
    Whether there were dynasties before the Han that accomplished something similar,
    it has not been recorded in writing.
  </p><p>
    The Han dynasty is one of China's longest dynasties (200 bc to 200 ce),
    existing around the time of the Roman empire in the west.
    Moreover, the Han dynasty is the namesake of the Han Chinese people (汉族)
    as well as Chinese characters or Hanzi (汉字).
    The Han was foundational to China's modern culture,
    establishing the writing system as well as being an innovational powerhouse.
  </p><p>
    Throughout its existence, the Han dynasty would fight various wars with the northern Xiongnu (匈奴),
    a people who inhabited the north Eurasian steppe, spanning from Northeast Asia to as far as Central Asia and the Pamir mountains.
    In the west, the Xiongnu may also be known as the Huns, the very nomadic people who destroyed the Roman empire.
  </p><p>
    So what does the Han-Xiongnu relationship have anything to do with the west or Sumeru?
    It turns out that the competition between the Han and Xiongnu directly impacted the fate of the west,
    shaping the history of the region that serves as inspiration for Sumeru.
