<title>The Western Regions</title>

  </head>
  
<body>
  <div id="includedContent"></div>


  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>The lands in the western parts of China and beyond
    were sometimes referred to as the Xiyu (西域),
    which literally translated means 'western regions'.
    The western regions play a huge role in China's history, the Silk Road, 
    as well as understanding the region of Sumeru and its relationship to Liyue and China.
  </p><p>
    In fact, to be even more direct, some may even equate the 'western regions' (Xiyu) with Sumeru itself.
  </p>

  <h2>Han dynasty</h2>
  <p>The Han dynasty (汉朝) was the first large Chinese dynasty in written history
    that conquered the western regions (or at least established hegemony over the region).
    Whether there were dynasties before the Han that accomplished something similar,
    it has not been recorded in writing.
  </p><p>
    The Han dynasty is one of China's longest dynasties (200 bc to 200 ce),
    existing around the time of the Roman empire in the west.
    Moreover, the Han dynasty is the namesake of the Han Chinese people (汉族)
    as well as Chinese characters or Hanzi (汉字).
    The Han was foundational to China's modern culture,
    establishing the writing system as well as being an innovational powerhouse.
  </p><p>
    Throughout its existence, the Han dynasty would fight various wars with the northern Xiongnu (匈奴),
    a people who inhabited the north Eurasian steppe, spanning from Northeast Asia to as far as Central Asia and the Pamir mountains.
    In the west, the Xiongnu may also be known as the Huns, the very nomadic people who destroyed the Roman empire.
  </p><p>
    So what does the Han-Xiongnu relationship have anything to do with the west or Sumeru?
    It turns out that the competition between the Han and Xiongnu directly impacted the fate of the west,
    shaping the history of the region that serves as inspiration for Sumeru.
    The includes Central Asia, South Asia, and even as far as Europe and the Middle East.
  </p><p>
    Let's start with the closest regions impacted by the Han-Xiongnu battles:
    Central Asia and South Asia.
    During this time, there were various kingdoms inhabiting Central Asia and western China.
    These include people such as the Yuezhi / Rouzhi, Tocharians, Kangju, Wusun, Sogdians, Saka, Daxia, Dayuan, etc.
    Many of these people were related to Eastern Iranian groups (or 'Aryans')
    or even Greco-Bactrian kingdoms.
    In particular, Daxia and Dayuan were remnants of the Greek Hellenistic empire 
    (as Alexander's campaigns reached as far east as Central Asia and the borders of India).
    So in ancient times, Central Asia had a fusion of Greek culture as well.
  </p><p>
    Eventually the Hellenistic empire split apart into several smaller states,
    and those at the more eastern boundaries of the Greek empire
    mixed more with the local culture such as the Scythian, Sogdian, and Saka (Sai) people 
    living near Central Asia and western China.
  </p><p>
    During the reign of Liu Che, the Han dynasty rapidly expanded in all directions,
    conquering Jiaochi to the south (modern Vietnam),
    the Xiongnu to the north,
    and various kingdoms in the western regions,
    asserting hegemony in East, North, Central, and even South Asia.
  </p><p>
    Liu Che is considered one of China's greatest emperors (even one of the greatest emperors of all time in the entire world).
  </p><p>
    Some people like to say that the Tang dynasty was also quite big and powerful.
    It is true that the Tang was another Chinese golden age, and its territory was vast after annexing the Tujue.
    But the truth is, the Han dynasty achieved the exact same thing in terms of territorial conquests before the Tang.
    During Liu Che's reign, after defeating the Xiongnu,
    the Han dynasty territory basically matched the Tang dynasty territory at its height,
    including all the vassal kingdoms,
    encompassing a vast region from Northeast Asia to Central Asia.
  </p><p>
    So the Han dynasty deserves a lot more credit.
    It was a Chinese golden age just like the Tang dynasty.
    And it was one of the few Chinese dynasties in history that unified north and south China (Han, Tang, Yuan, Qing).
  </p>

  <h2>Xiongnu and Huns</h2>
  <p>In the Battle of Mobei, the Han dynasty defeated the Xiongnu (around modern-day Mongolia).
    This is considered a turning point in the history of the Han dynasty and Xiongnu.
    Thereafter, the Xiongnu would never recover the strength they once had under the Modu Chanyu.
    The Xiongnu would split into smaller clans and would become vassals of the Han dynasty (e.g. the Southern Xiongnu).
    Eventually, some Xiongnu would either completely assimilate into Han Chinese culture,
    and others would flee west becoming various other nomadic tribes such as the Xionites, Hephthalites, Huns,
    and cause the collapse of the Roman empire and various empires in India.
  </p><p>
    The fact that the Han dynasty was able to defeat the Xiongnu / Huns,
    but that the Huns were able to cause the collapse of empires in the west and South Asia
    shows how powerful the Han dynasty was at the time.
  </p>

  <p>The Xiongnu did not completely fade away in history.
    Even in Europe, there is a country named Hungary, taking its name after the Huns.
    As for whether the modern Hungarians are descended from these ancient Hunnic people
    is a subject of modern research.
    Nonetheless, the modern Hunagarian language has been identified as part of the Finno-Ugric language family,
    which is quite different from surrounding European (Aryan) languages and Turkic languages.
  </p><p>
    This sort of aligns with how the original Xiongnu language still remains to be classified.
    Scholars are unsure which family the Xiongnu language belonged to,
    with various hypotheses existing: Altaic, Nadene/Yeniseian/Jie/Ket, even Sinitic.
    It may even be the case that the Xiongnu spoke its own language isolate
    as North Asia is known to be the home for various different language groups.
  </p>

  <p>And then there were the Xiongnu who chose to become Han Chinese and assimilate into China.
    It is in this sense that the Xiongnu can be considered as an ethnic minority (少数民族) of China,
    in the same sense that Mongols, Man, etc. are also ethnic minorities in China.
  </p>


  <h2>Western kingdoms: Rome, Persia, Greece</h2>
  <p>The various kingdoms in the western regions have been recorded in Chinese history
    by famous Han dynasty explorers such as Zhang Qian and Ban Chao.
    These explorers traveled to Central Asia and the borders of South Asia.
    They even made contact with the Roman Empire (probably via envoys in the Parthian empire of Persia).
    The ancient Chinese term for the Roman Empire was Daqin (大秦),
    which may refer to Syria, one of the eastern most points of the Roman Empire.
    The name Daqin contains the character Qin (秦), 
    also the name of the Qin dynasty, the predecessor of the Han dynasty.
    Whether Daqin is just a transliteration of a Roman placename into Chinese
    or something that symbolizes a connection between Rome and the Qin dynasty
    is a question of modern research.
    It will just be mentioned that Han Chinese DNA has been found in the tombs of Roman soldiers in Britain.
    So perhaps somehow, through the steppe migrations, ancient Chinese moved with the nomads and landed in Rome.
  </p><p>
    The name for India during the Han dynasty was Shendu.
    During this time, there was a fusion of Greek, Persian, and Saka culture to India's north (in Central Asia).
    The culture of Central Asia during the Han dynasty was quite different from the Central Asia we know today.
    This time period was long before the Arabic Islamic wave, the Mongol-Turkic wave, 
    and the Soviet Russia influence in Central Asia.
  </p>

  <p>For example, during the Han dynasty,
    one of the main religions of Central Asia was Buddhism,
    which was even prevalent in Iran at the time,
    alongside Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism (and later Christianity) 
    and other Greek cultures (from Alexander's empire).
    It is said that the various Central Asian kingdoms and merchants 
    helped spread Buddhism between west China and north India 
    during the time of the Han dynasty.
  </p><p>
    One such Central Asian kingdom was called Dayuan (大宛),
    which is thought to refer to Ionians.
  </p><p>
    Another group of people in this region were the Yuezhi / Rouzhi (月氏) and the Tocharians.
    There is debate on whether the original Yuezhi were more related to Han-Tibetan Qiang (羌) people or the Tocharians.
    But essentially, these people lived in western China and Central Asia.
    The Tocharians spoke a language that is linguistically related to Aryan languages,
    including Persian, Hindustani, and various European languages.
  </p><p>
    All these groups later became part of the Han dynasty and helped fight against the northern Xiongnu.
  </p>

  <p>Then there were the Saka (Sai) and Sogdians,
    a group of Eastern Iranian people.
    The Sogdians were merchants who helped facilitate trade along the Silk Road between China, India, and Persia.
    They helped spread Buddhism between these various civilizations.
    Many became part of the Han dynasty,
    and they would later also become part of the Tang dynasty.
  </p><p>
    The Sogdians were probably related to an even more ancient group of Aryan nomads called the Scythians.
    The Scythians were people who migrated via the steppe into Europe and Persia.
    They probably originated from western and northern China, similar to the Xiongnu, Tocharians, etc.
  </p>

  <p>The point is the further back in history one goes,
    the more one realizes how closely related China and the western regions were (India, Persia, even Europe).
    Even as far back as the Han dynasty and before,
    it can be clearly observed that many of the people who migrated into these western regions
    actually originated from China itself.
    Keeping this history in mind can help explain some of the connections between Liyue and Sumeru in Genshin Impact.
  </p>
  <p>
    But perhaps more importantly, China and the west have a long shared history on the Silk Road,
    involving the movement and flow of goods, people, religions like Buddhism, and ideas.
    As is described in Buddhism, all things in the world are interconnected,
    and throughout history, China has always exerted a deep influence across the whole Eurasian continent.
  </p>


  <h2>Post-Han regression</h2>
  <p>After the collapse of the Han, the world was once more divided into warring states.
    Meanwhile in the west, the Huns, Alans, Yancai invaded Europe and North Africa (Roman Empire),
    while the Xionites, Kushan, etc. invaded India.
  </p><p>
    As for China itself, there was the three kingdoms period, 
    as captured in the legendary classic Sanguozhi (三国志).
    This period of history, featuring giants such as Cao Cao, Liu Bei, and others,
    has so captured the public imagination that a play was even written about it called 
    the Romance of the Three Kingdoms (三国演义).
    These works of history and literature are the subject of endless conversations of scholarly analysis.
  </p><p>
    After the three kingdoms period rose the Jin (晋) dynasty.
    And after that there were several other successor states in China.
    The most important developments were:
    1) the Xiongnu gradually assimilated into Han Chinese culture,
    2) in the northern steppe, new tribes such as the Tiele, Dingling, Rouran, and eventually the Gokturks rose to power,
    3) power became more centralized in mainland China.
  </p><p>
    As the saying goes, the empire long divided must unite.
  </p><p>
    So what was that empire that eventually unified all the players in the Sinosphere?
  </p>


  <h2>Tang dynasty, Turks, and Arabs</h2>
  <p>This opens the second chapter in the history of China and the west.
    If the Han was the first great Chinese empire that expanded to and conquered the west, 
    then the Tang is the second great Chinese empire to accomplish that.
    And this is where several Sumeru characters tie in, including Cyno, Alhaitham, and Dehya.
  </p><p>
    Cyno is a blend of the Tang, Turkic, Saka, and Arab syncretic influence that defined China during this time period.
