<title>The Western Regions</title>

  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>The lands in the western parts and beyond of China
    were sometimes referred to as the Xiyu (西域),
    which literally translated means 'western regions'.
    The western regions play a huge role in China's history 
    as well as understanding the region of Sumeru and its relationship to Liyue and China.
  </p><p>
    In fact, to be even more direct, some may even equate the 'western regions' (Xiyu) with Sumeru itself.
  </p>

  <h2>Han dynasty</h2>
  <p>The Han dynasty (汉朝) was the first large Chinese dynasty in written history
    that conquered the western regions (or at least established hegemony over the region).
    Whether there were dynasties before the Han that accomplished something similar,
    it has not been recorded in writing.
  </p><p>
    The Han dynasty is one of China's longest dynasties (200 bc to 200 ce),
    existing around the time of the Roman empire in the west.
    Moreover, the Han dynasty is the namesake of the Han Chinese people (汉族)
    as well as Chinese characters or Hanzi (汉字).
    The Han was foundational to China's modern culture,
    establishing the writing system as well as being an innovational powerhouse.
  </p><p>
    Throughout its existence, the Han dynasty would fight various wars with the northern Xiongnu (匈奴),
    a people who inhabited the north Eurasian steppe, spanning from Northeast Asia to as far as Central Asia and the Pamir mountains.
    In the west, the Xiongnu may also be known as the Huns, the very nomadic people who destroyed the Roman empire.
  </p><p>
    So what does the Han-Xiongnu relationship have anything to do with the west or Sumeru?
    It turns out that the competition between the Han and Xiongnu directly impacted the fate of the west,
    shaping the history of the region that serves as inspiration for Sumeru.
    The includes Central Asia, South Asia, and even as far as Europe and the Middle East.
  </p><p>
    Let's start with the closest regions impacted by the Han-Xiongnu battles:
    Central Asia and South Asia.
    During this time, there were various kingdoms inhabiting Central Asia and western China.
    These include people such as the Yuezhi / Rouzhi, Tocharians, Kangju, Wusun, Sogdians, Saka, Daxia, Dayuan, etc.
    Many of these people were related to Eastern Iranian groups (or 'Aryans')
    or even Greco-Bactrian kingdoms.
    In particular, Daxia and Dayuan were remnants of the Greek Hellenistic empire 
    (as Alexander's campaigns reached as far east as Central Asia and the borders of India).
    So in ancient times, Central Asia had a fusion of Greek culture as well.
  </p><p>
    Eventually the Hellenistic empire split apart into several smaller states,
    and those at the more eastern boundaries of the Greek empire
    mixed more with the local culture such as the Scythian, Sogdian, and Saka (Sai) people 
    living near Central Asia and western China.
  </p><p>
    During the reign of Liu Che, the Han dynasty rapidly expanded in all directions,
    conquering Jiaochi to the south (modern Vietnam),
    the Xiongnu to the north,
    and various kingdoms in the western regions,
    asserting hegemony in East, North, Central, and even South Asia.
  </p><p>
    Liu Che is considered one of China's greatest emperors (even one of the greatest emperors of all time in the entire world).
  </p><p>
    Some people like to say that the Tang dynasty was also quite big and powerful.
    It is true that the Tang was another Chinese golden age, and its territory was vast after annexing the Tujue.
    But the truth is, the Han dynasty achieved the exact same thing in terms of territorial conquests before the Tang.
    During Liu Che's reign, after defeating the Xiongnu,
    the Han dynasty territory basically matched the Tang dynasty territory at its height,
    including all the vassal kingdoms,
    encompassing a vast region from Northeast Asia to Central Asia.
  </p><p>
    So the Han dynasty deserves a lot more credit.
    It was a Chinese golden age just like the Tang dynasty.
    And it was one of the few Chinese dynasties in history that unified north and south China (Han, Tang, Yuan, Qing).
