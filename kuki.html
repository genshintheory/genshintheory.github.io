  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>Her E sacrifices her health (30% hp) and creates an electro ring that heals you (similar to Qiqi's E).
    It does a pulse every 1.5s and has standard icd
    (for example it will aggravate every other pulse).
    The healing scales with her hp.
    The duration is 12s but with c2 it increases to 15s (giving it 100% uptime).
  </p><p>
    Her c1 increases her E aoe by 50%.
    Her c4 gives her more sub-dps.
    Her c6 is similar to Hu Tao's c6 (involving lethal damage).
  </p><p>
    Her Q does dot that synergizes with the quicken reaction (multiple procs over time).
    Her Q is very similar to Collei's Q.
  </p><p>
    One of her passives increases her healing and Q damage based on her EM.
  </p><p>
    If her hp is less than 50% she gains buffs: 
    increased healing and increased q damage (q field lasts longer).
    Her q has pretty decent scaling.
    At level 13 it does around 92% hp as total damage
    (and roughly 12 procs).
    To translate, this is equivalent to 920% atk scaling (a nuke).
    And considering this can aggravate, it can do more damage, especially when factoring in EM scaling.
    Assuming standard icd, she can do 4 procs of aggravate with her q.
  </p>

  
  <h2>Build</h2>
  <p>
    For artifacts, one can use 4p tenacity, 4p gilded (for em), noblesse, ocean clam, etc.
    One can do full HP build, EM build, electro-crit, or hybrid build.
  </p>

  <h2>Best weapons include Xiphos, Iron Sting, Alley Hunter, Freedom-Sworn (for EM), 
    Favonius, Skyward, Sacrificial (for ER),
    Khaj-Nisut (for HP), 
    any crit weapon (for damage).
    Harbinger of Dawn is not recommended since Kuki often drains her own hp.
  </h2>

  <h2>Teams</h2>
  <p>She can be used on any team that needs healing, including Xiao teams (even her c4 works for plunging).</p>
  <p>Her electro application particularly synergizes well with some electro and dendro characters, 
    such as Cyno, Nahida, Collei,
    and Kuki synergizes well in taser, quicken, and hyperbloom teams.
  </p>
  <p>As part of the Arataki gang, does she synergize with Itto?
    She can heal Itto for sure.
    But note that some of Itto's best teammates are not necessarily from the Arataki gang 
    (i.e. Gorou).
  </p><p>
    Kuki is a better electro healer than Dori.
