  <p>Kuki Shinobu is a ninja healer and Arataki gang member
    that can drive hyperbloom.
  </p>


  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>Her E sacrifices her health (30% hp) and creates an electro ring that heals you (similar to Qiqi's E).
    It does a pulse every 1.5s and has standard icd
    (for example it will aggravate every other pulse).
    The healing scales with her hp.
    The duration is 12s but with c2 it increases to 15s (giving it 100% uptime).
  </p><p>
    Her c1 increases her E aoe by 50%.
    Her c4 gives her more sub-dps.
    Her c6 is similar to Hu Tao's c6 (involving lethal damage).
  </p><p>
    Her Q does dot that synergizes with the quicken reaction (multiple procs over time).
    Her Q is very similar to Collei's Q.
  </p><p>
    One of her passives increases her healing and E damage based on her EM.
  </p><p>
    If her hp is less than 50% she gains buffs: 
    increased healing and increased q damage (q field lasts longer).
    Her q has pretty decent scaling.
    At level 13 it does around 92% hp as total damage
    (and roughly 12 procs).
    To translate, this is equivalent to 920% atk scaling (a nuke).
    And considering this can aggravate, it can do more damage, especially when factoring in EM scaling.
    Assuming standard icd, she can do 4 procs of aggravate with her q.
  </p>

  
  <h2>Build</h2>
  <p>
    For artifacts, one can use 4p tenacity, 4p gilded (for em), noblesse, ocean clam, etc.
    One can do full HP build, EM build, electro-crit, or hybrid build.
  </p>

  <p>Best weapons include Xiphos, Iron Sting, Alley Hunter, Freedom-Sworn (for EM), 
    Favonius, Skyward, Sacrificial (for ER),
    Khaj-Nisut (for HP), 
    any crit weapon (for damage).
    Harbinger of Dawn is not recommended since Kuki often drains her own hp.
  </p>

  <h2>Teams</h2>
  <p>She can be used on any team that needs healing, including Xiao teams (even her c4 works for plunging).</p>
  <p>Her electro application particularly synergizes well with some electro and dendro characters, 
    such as Cyno, Nahida, Alhaitham, Collei
    and Kuki synergizes well in taser, quicken, and hyperbloom teams.
  </p><p>
    One example taser team is Scaramouche, Nahida, Kuki, Yelan.
    An example of a quickbloom team is Alhaitham, Nahida, Kuki, Yelan.
  </p>
  <p>As part of the Arataki gang, does she synergize with Itto?
    She can heal Itto for sure.
    But note that some of Itto's best teammates are not necessarily from the Arataki gang 
    (i.e. Gorou).
  </p><p>
    Kuki is a better electro healer than Dori.
    It makes sense why Itto chose Kuki over Dori.
  </p>


  <h2>Calculations</h2>
  <p>Suppose she has 46.6% electro dmg bonus and 200 em (e.g. tenacity + em sword).
    Suppose she uses an hp sands and has 30k hp.
    As mentioned above, when using it under 50% hp,
    her q has a total of 92% hp scaling which is about 920% atk scaling (compared to 3k atk with Bennett).
  </p><p>
    The dps is
    $$x_q = 920*1.466/15 = 89.9$$
  </p><p>
    This can proc aggravate up to 4 times.
    With 200 em, the additive damage is
    $$1446.85*1.15*(1+5*200/1400) = 2852$$
    or about 95% extra scaling per aggravate (divide above by 3k atk).
  </p><p>
    The dps with 4 aggravates is then
    $$x_q = (920+4*95)*1.466/15 = 127$$
  </p>

  <h3>Healing</h3>
  <p>Full EM build (with 4p gilded, Iron Sting/Dongfang sword) is viable and may not hurt the healing by much
    because Kuki has a passive that converts 75% of EM into E healing.
    The purpose of full EM build is for hyperbloom teams where Kuki drives hyperbloom.
    For hyperbloom drivers, one usually only needs full EM build and lv90 (as reaction damage depends on EM and level).
    This makes hyperbloom teams quite friendly to build.
  </p><p>
    Suppose with HP sands, Kuki can reach 30k hp.
    Suppose on full EM (replacing HP sands with EM sands), Kuki can reach 1k EM, but now has 20k hp.
    Assume lv13 E which heals 6.37% HP + 794.5.
    By switching to a full EM build, Kuki loses 10k hp or 637 healing,
    but with 1k EM, she converts that into 750 healing via her passive, which cancels the loss in healing.
    In other words, by switching to a full EM build from an HP build, 
    Kuki may not lose much in healing at all because she can convert EM into healing.
    Moreover, Kuki ascends with HP%, forsaking an HP sands for an EM sands does not incur too much of a loss.
    This provides great flexibility when building hyperbloom teams, where we want more EM to make hyperbloom do more damage,
    without sacrificing the healing benefits Kuki provides.
  </p><p>
    For reference with 30k hp, lv13 E, Kuki can heal 2705.5 per tick,
    which for most teams is good enough.
    By contrast, C4 Gorou with 2k DEF will heal 1000 per tick.
  </p><p>    
    Kuki's advantage as a hyperbloom driver are her 100% uptime (at C2) and the fact that she heals (as opposed to Raiden/Yae/Fischl).
    Some room for improvement is that her electro app is limited within the aoe around the character
    (so you have to be close to the enemy),
    whereas Raiden and Yae have much larger ranges (which is fine for hyperbloom since the sprawling shots can autotarget).
  </p>

  <p>
    There is a pattern with the sounds chu, zhu, qiu, and jiu in Chinese.
    Both Kujou and Kuki contain the jiu sound.
    Jiu is also the name of the villain in the Azhdaha quest.
