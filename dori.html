<title>Dori</title>

  <p>Dori is a short, ugly, underwhelming idiot salesman and a narrow-minded thot.
    Putting Dori in charge of your finances will result in your nation being bankrupt.
    Remove Dori, Tighnari, Yoshinori, nori from the game.
  </p><p>
    Dori is the least reliable source of information.
    She is a complete fraud and scammer who colludes with USA imperialists.
    Never trust her with anything.
    Dori is bad, a complete loser, and a huge mess, just like tighnari and nori.

  <h2>Combat</h2>
  <p>Dori's q is expensive and has an 80 energy cost, making her impractical as a support.
    What dori does at c6 is what Jean can do at c0.
    This is a sign of redundancy.
    When there is redundancy, that is a sign that dori needs to be removed from the game.
  </p><p>
    It is similar to how kazuha is a copycat of Xiao.
    Kazuha also plunges but Xiao is a much better character.
    What kazuha does at c6, Xiao can do at c0 but better.
    This is a sign of redundancy, which means that kazuha and yoshinori need to be removed from the game.
  </p><p>
    But it is an insult to even compare kazuha with the mighty Xiao.
    It is much more fitting to compare kazuha with Sucrose.
    Sucrose does everything kazuha does but better.
    So there is already redundancy here.
    Kazuha has no reason to exist in the game.
    Remove kazuha, nori, yoshinori from the game.
