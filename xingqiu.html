<p><b>Xingqiu</b> (行秋) is a Hydro support character and friend of Chongyun.
</p>

<h2>Talents</h2>

<h3>Elemental Burst</h3>
<p>
	The reason Xingqiu is used is for his off field Hydro application through his burst.
</p>
<p>
Constellation Lv. 6 increases the damage of every third sword rain attack during this Talent's duration (creates 5 sword rains). 
Xingqiu regenerates 3 Energy when the third Rain Sword attack hits enemies.
Normally, sword rain alternates between firing 2 swords and 3 swords. 
With C6, the order is 2 swords → 3 swords → 5 swords.
There is usually a 1s delay between successive waves.
The burst lasts 15s.
</p><p>
Without any Constellations, this skill at Talent Level 10 has a scaling of 97.7% per sword. 
On average, there are 25 instances of Rain Sword DMG, resulting in a total scaling of 2442.5%.
At C6, this skill at Talent Level 13 has a scaling of 115% per sword. 
On average, there are \(10*5 = 50\) instances of Rain Sword DMG, resulting in a total scaling of 5750%.
</p><p>
	We assume Xingqiu has a Hydro DMG Bonus goblet.
	He gets 20% Hydro DMG through his passive.
	The total DMG Bonus on the burst is
	$$46.6 + 20 = 66.6$$
	The burst has a 20 second cd, so the DPS at C0 is
	$$x_0 = 1.666*2442.5/20 = 203.46025$$
	and the DPS at C6 is
	$$x_6 = 1.666*5750/20 = 478.975$$
  Note this is really all single target damage.
  Other characters will have a greater advantage in AoE situations.
</p><p>
Childe and Xingqiu are sometimes compared.
A C0 Childe can do more damage than a C0 Xingqiu.
At C6, Xingqiu may be competitive in single target damage with a C0 Childe.
However, Childe has better AoE, has Riptide, and his Hydro application does not cost energy whereas Xingqiu's Hydro application does.
