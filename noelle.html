  <h2>Talents</h2>
  <p>Noelle's kit is very similar to Itto's.
    Her Q converts her def into additional atk
    and converts her damage to geo.
    One difference is that even if she is switched off field,
    the geo infusion will still remain if you switch back into her.
    The duration is also longer at 15s.
    Moreover, the aoe of her claymore attacks has larger planar aoe
    (Itto has larger vertical aoe).
    Also when she attacks, she can heal the party (with one of her constellations the probability goes up).
  </p><p>
    On the other hand, her E generates a geo shield.
    With one of her constellations, after the shield expires it will deal damage with 400% atk scaling.
    The initial cd is 18s, but this can be reduced with her other abilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Her optimal build is very similar to Itto's:
    4p husk, def sands, whiteblind and redhorn her bis weapons.
