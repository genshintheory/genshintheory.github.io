<h2>Link and Navi</h2>
<p>So if Cyno and Lyney are like Zelda and Link,
  then Lyney and Navia are maybe like Link and Navi.
</p><p>
  Navia's voice actor is Xiaogan, the same voice actor for Sucrose.
  What is this supposed to be: a Wei Wuxian, Xiao Zhan reference?
</p>

<p>That said, the beta base atk (November 9) for Navia does not seem fair to the rest of the Genshin characters
  or those who have been following the game for several years now,
  especially given the treatment of Fu Xuan in Star Rail, Garvipidam for TCG, the Sumeru cast, etc.
  Does Itto want to prepare to have a successor for def?
</p><p>
  Otherwise it disrupts the balance in the game:
  we have an anemo, geo, pyro for each stat atk, def, hp,
  and each had 70 energy cost.
</p><p>
  Also this does not seem very patriotic at all.
  If Liyue is like China, then it is more patriotic to have Xiao with highest base atk.
  Second, Liu Wei is the CEO of mihoyo / hoyoverse,
  so we need to ask how people feel when they give Itto (Liu Zhaokun) the highest def and how they treat Navia (Na Wei Ya).
  Are people creating a game just to benefit themselves or the people?
</p><p>
  Moreover, this came a bit suddenly with no prior warning. 
  Genshin has usually had a reasonable track record when designing character kits (unlike Honkai Star Rail).
  However, this design for Navia in the 4.3 beta suggests something is seriously off in the world.
</p><p>
  It is suggested that centralized authorities start a system of auditing game companies and all private equity (non-public corporations).
  They need the power to veto decisions they make.
  Otherwise these private fiefs have way too much freedom of choice, causing negative effects on society.
  Regulation is needed.
</p>
<p>And if you are trying to use Alexandrina Victoria as a basis for strength,
  you need to remember that Victoria is not her surname.
  Alexandrina is closer to her surname.
  So if you are only basing it on Victoria without Alexandrina, then you are scamming the people.
</p><p>
  So Alatus (Xiao) is actually more faithful.
  Like literally, Xiao is called Alatus, the Vigilant Yaksha.
  This is a much better representation of Alexandrina Victoria.
</p>
<p>Centralized authority may want to prepare succession planning for certain game devs and leaders of companies
  given how hostile some of the recent version contents have been.
  Game developers are not above the law.
  And it becomes especially worrisome when these devs are so easily manipulated and brainwashed by USA media.
  It is honestly not much different from letting a USA colony control the media of 1 billion people.
  It is greatly recommended that a centralized authority regulate and audit this industry more heavily.
</p><p>
  Another idea is to institute rotating chairmen/CEO for certain game companies.
