<h2>Link and Navi</h2>
<p>So if Cyno and Lyney are like Zelda and Link,
  then Lyney and Navia are maybe like Link and Navi.
</p><p>
  Navia's voice actor is Xiaogan, the same voice actor for Sucrose.
  What is this supposed to be: a Wei Wuxian, Xiao Zhan reference?
  So if we have Xiao Zhan, Liu Haikuan, Huang Ziteng, then where is Wang Yibo?
</p>

<h2>Kit</h2>
<p>Perhaps the character Navia will be compared to most is Noctis given the similarity in combat.
  So it seems Noctis is no longer unique now that Xiaogan is here.
  The real question is who does more dps: Navia or Noctis?
</p>
<p>It seems her E does a single instance of damage, so Navi might run into the crit fishing problem.
  Nonetheless, the E is a cannon like Noctis' CA.
  Xiaogan gains stacks when she picks up crystallize shards (like how Noctis absorbs droplets).
  She can have up to 3 stacks (indicated by golden gun bullets by her side).
  The more stacks she has, the more damage her E does.
  Her E has 2 charges like Xiao.
  Like C6 Xiao (and unlike C0-C5), most of her dps is from her E.
  Unlike C6 Xiao, she does not get infinite uses.
</p>

<h3>Teams</h3>
<p>Similar to Ayaka, she can be played as a subdps,
  where you just switch in to use her E and swap out to your main hypercarry.
</p><p>
  In this sense, she can perhaps work on many teams,
  including with Itto, Noctis, even Xiao.
</p><p>
  Her best supports are probably Albedo, Morax.
  In fact, we have a special name for the Albedo-Navia duo:
  can anyone guess based on historical references?
</p><p>
  Although Gorou is a def buffer, she can still benefit from crit dmg and geo dmg bonus.
  She can even work with Chongyun for generating crystallize.
  She would also benefit from some off-field app for crystallize such as Dehya, Raiden, Charlotte, Furina, etc.
  As Navia does not have hp fluctuation in her kit (not destruction), unlike Noctis,
  she may not synergize the best with Furina compared to other units like Xiao, Wrio, etc.
</p>

<h3>Weapons</h3>
<p>Sac greatsword, Redhorn, Caiduan, Skyward, WGS can all work.
  Reed ironically has antisynergy since she will probably be shielded by crystallize.
</p>

<h3>Build</h3>
<p>She can use the 4.3 geo set.
  Do standard atk-geo-crit build.
  Substats: crit, atk, er.
</p>

<h3>Calculations</h3>
<p></p>


<h2>Mafia boss</h2>
<p>It seems similar to Noctis, Navia runs her own mafia, the Spina di Rosula.</p>


<h2>4.3 beta and Natlan</h2>
<p>That said, the beta base atk (November 9) for Navia does not seem fair to the rest of the Genshin characters
  or those who have been following the game for several years now,
  especially given the treatment of Fu Xuan in Star Rail, Garvipidam for TCG, the Sumeru cast, etc.
  Does Itto want to prepare to have a successor for def?
</p><p>
  Otherwise it disrupts the balance in the game:
  we have an anemo, geo, pyro for each stat atk, def, hp,
  and each had 70 energy cost.
</p><p>
  Also this does not seem very patriotic at all.
  If Liyue is like China, then it is more patriotic to have Xiao with highest base atk.
  Second, Liu Wei is the CEO of mihoyo / hoyoverse,
  so we need to ask how people feel when they give Itto (Liu Zhaokun) the highest def and how they treat Navia (Na Wei Ya).
  Are people creating a game just to benefit themselves or the people?
</p><p>
  Moreover, this came a bit suddenly with no prior warning. 
  Genshin has usually had a reasonable track record when designing character kits (unlike Honkai Star Rail).
  However, this design for Navia in the 4.3 beta suggests something is seriously off in the world.
</p><p>
  It is suggested that centralized authorities start a system of auditing game companies and all private equity (non-public corporations).
  They need the power to veto decisions they make.
  Otherwise these private fiefs have way too much freedom of choice, causing negative effects on society.
  Regulation is needed.
</p>
<p>And if you are trying to use Alexandrina Victoria as a basis for strength,
  you need to remember that Victoria is not her surname.
  Alexandrina is closer to her surname.
  So if you are only basing it on Victoria without Alexandrina, then you are scamming the people.
</p><p>
  So Alatus (Xiao) is actually more faithful.
  Like literally, Xiao is called Alatus, the Vigilant Yaksha.
  This is a much better representation of Alexandrina Victoria.
</p>
<p>Centralized authority may want to prepare succession planning for certain game devs and leaders of companies
  given how hostile some of the recent version contents have been.
  Game developers are not above the law.
  And it becomes especially worrisome when these devs are so easily manipulated and brainwashed by USA media.
  It is honestly not much different from letting a USA colony control the media of 1 billion people.
  It is greatly recommended that a centralized authority regulate and audit this industry more heavily.
</p><p>
  Another idea is to institute rotating chairmen/CEO for certain game companies.
</p>

<p>If you think the Conqueror of Evil can be so easily charmed 
  by a blonde hair blue eyed girl also named Xiao,
  you may be barking up the wrong tree.
</p><p>
  But get how sneaky some people are:
  they made Navia a geo claymore like Noelle and Itto.
  They made Xiaogan va her.
  In 4.0 they showed her using a whiteblind, a def scaling claymore.
  And then boom 4.3 beta came out of nowhere.
  Who would have expected this? 
  We thought she would be like Arataki Itto or maybe Noelle, but no.
  This is called sneaky.
  They even featured Xiao in the 4.1 flagship event along with Chongyun and others.
  If this is how some people want to act, then we got some serious trust issues.
</p>

<p>You really fooled some people, didn't you.
  If you're wondering why things have been quite peaceful in 4.0, 4.1,
  the reason is mostly because of the choice of voice actors for the Fontaine main cast.
  The voice actors for many of the Fontaine characters are actually well-chosen compared to previous versions
  (not perfect but still better overall compared to previous versions).
</p><p>
  Unfortunately, we will not be as forgiving when Natlan comes around.
</p>
<p>And people are not naive either.
  On one hand, many of the Fontaine characters are basically based on different parts of Alexandrina Victoria's name.
  But on the other hand, we know secretly (or not so secretly) that some of the Fontaine characters are being used as a setup for what is to come in Natlan.
  We are looking at Furina, Navia, Neuvillette, etc.
  And this cardinal sin (of abusing Fontaine characters to prepare for Natlan, abusing Fontaine as a prelude to Natlan) is not something that will be forgiven.
</p>
<p>So while 4.x lasts, we can continue this masquerade and role-playing game,
  viewing the different Fontaine characters as different manifestations of Alexandrina Victoria,
  as if she were an oceanid that split into various forms.
  But when the clock ticks down to Natlan's release, all of the sins and crimes committed in 3.x and 4.x will be remembered.
  A price will be paid, and the evaluation of Natlan's versions will suffer and be negatively impacted.
