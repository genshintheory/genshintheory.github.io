<h2>Link and Navi</h2>
<p>So if Cyno and Lyney are like Zelda and Link,
  then Lyney and Navia are maybe like Link and Navi.
</p><p>
  Navia's voice actor is Xiaogan, the same voice actor for Sucrose.
</p>

<p>That said, the beta base atk (November 9) for Navia does not seem fair to the rest of the Genshin characters
  or those who have been following the game for several years now,
  especially given the treatment of Fu Xuan in Star Rail, Garvipidam for TCG, the Sumeru cast, etc.
  Does Itto want to prepare to have a successor for def?
</p><p>
  Moreover, this came a bit suddenly with no prior warning. 
  Genshin has usually had a reasonable track record when designing character kits (unlike Star Rail).
  However, this design for Navia in the 4.3 beta suggests something is seriously off in the world.
