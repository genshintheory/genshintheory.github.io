  <p>This is possibly a reference to penal colony of the British empire.
    And whenever you think of the British empire...
    you guessed it, we're going to be talking about the Victorian era.
  </p><p>
    How is it that literally everybody knows about the Mongols, even Alexander the Great of Greece,
    but fewer people know about Alexandrina Victoria,
    when the British empire literally conquered a ton of territory comparable to the Mongols?
  </p><p>
    At least in the USA, whoever is in charge of the education system must think that if all USA children
    were educated about Queen Victoria, that would enable so many people...
    Perhaps only the educated, mature people could be trusted to handle the truth of history.
    So this is how the USA elites (aristocrats) 'condition' and 'contain' its young children.
    Also, there could be some geopolitics between the modern Britain and USA...
