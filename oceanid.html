<h2>Fontaine Oceanid Theory</h2>
<p>There is a fan theory circulating around that the people of Fontaine are actually similar to hydro eidolons or oceanids.
  They can combine form and split like other oceanids.
  Moreover, that is partly why they dissolve in primordial water whereas non-Fontaine people do not:
  because the bodies of native Fontaine people are different.
</p>
<p>Part of this theory is that Egeria was an oceanid
  who created the people of Fontaine
  and that the Fontaine people are like hydro eidolons, made from Egeria's body.
  This would explain how Rene and Jakob have bodies similar to the sacred lotus in Sumeru,
  which is made of Egeria's remains.
  Moreover, Rene discovered how to merge with other beings and split like an oceanid.
  He was discovering that his own body was like an oceanid's.
</p><p>
  As the theory goes, during the cataclysm, Egeria split herself,
  sending her main body to Sumeru to fight the abyss,
  while also leaving behind a part of herself in the Oratrice and another part as Furina, the figurehead / mascot of Fontaine.
