<h2>Fontaine Oceanid Theory</h2>
<p>There is a fan theory circulating around that the people of Fontaine are actually similar to hydro eidolons or oceanids.
  They can combine form and split like other oceanids.
  Moreover, that is partly why they dissolve in primordial water whereas non-Fontaine people do not:
  because the bodies of native Fontaine people are different.
</p>
<p>Part of this theory is that Egeria was an oceanid
  who created the people of Fontaine
  and that the Fontaine people are like hydro eidolons, made from Egeria's body.
  This would explain how Rene and Jakob have bodies similar to the sacred lotus in Sumeru,
  which is made of Egeria's remains.
  Moreover, Rene discovered how to merge with other beings and split like an oceanid.
  He was discovering that his own body was like an oceanid's.
  Later on, Rene would attempt to create one giant oceanid to save Fontaine from the cataclysm.
</p><p>
  As the theory goes, during the cataclysm, Egeria split herself,
  sending her main body to Sumeru to fight the abyss,
  while also leaving behind a part of herself in the Oratrice and another part as Furina, the figurehead / mascot of Fontaine.
</p>

<p>In the 3.8 event, it is revealed that the people met in bottleland are hydro eidolons cast in human form
  acting as people that once met Idiya.
  Some have pointed out that the event stories in 1.6 and 2.8
  serve as an allegorical and symbolic prelude to the subsequent archon quests in Inazuma and Sumeru.
  So they predict that 3.8 is a prelude to the Fontaine AQ
  in the sense that the people of Fontaine are like eidolons created from the body of Egeria,
  similar to how the Melusines are created from the blood cells of the deceased dragon Elynas.
</p>
<p>One question this theory raises then is how come when using elemental sight,
  Fontaine people do not appear blue?
